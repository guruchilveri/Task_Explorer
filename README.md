## Core React

1.  ### What is React?

    React (aka React.js or ReactJS) is an **open-source front-end JavaScript library** for building user interfaces based on components. It's used for handling the view layer in web and mobile applications, and allows developers to create reusable UI components and manage the state of those components efficiently.

    React was created by [Jordan Walke](https://github.com/jordwalke), a software engineer at Facebook (now Meta). It was first deployed on Facebook's News Feed in 2011 and on Instagram in 2012. The library was open-sourced in May 2013 and has since become one of the most popular JavaScript libraries for building modern user interfaces.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

   2.  ### What is the history behind React evolution?
       The history of ReactJS started in 2010 with the creation of **XHP**. XHP is a PHP extension which improved the syntax of the language such that XML document fragments become valid PHP expressions and the primary purpose was used to create custom and reusable HTML elements.

       The main principle of this extension was to make front-end code easier to understand and to help avoid cross-site scripting attacks. The project was successful to prevent the malicious content submitted by the scrubbing user.

       But there was a different problem with XHP in which dynamic web applications require many roundtrips to the server, and XHP did not solve this problem. Also, the whole UI was re-rendered for small change in the application. Later, the initial prototype of React is created with the name **FaxJ** by Jordan inspired from XHP. Finally after sometime React has been introduced as a new library into JavaScript world.

       <details>
           <summary><b>See deep-dive answer</b></summary>
           The evolution of React has a fascinating history that spans over a decade:
    
       **2010-2011: The Origins**
       - The journey began with **XHP**, a PHP extension created at Facebook that allowed HTML components to be used in PHP code
       - XHP improved front-end code readability and helped prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks
       - However, XHP had limitations with dynamic web applications, requiring frequent server roundtrips and complete UI re-renders for small changes

       **2011-2012: Early Development**
       - Jordan Walke created the first prototype called **FaxJS** (later renamed to React), inspired by XHP's component model
       - The key innovation was bringing XHP's component model to JavaScript with performance improvements
       - React introduced the Virtual DOM concept to solve the performance issues of full page re-renders
       - First deployed internally on Facebook's News Feed in 2011 and Instagram in 2012

       **2013: Public Release**
       - React was officially open-sourced at JSConf US in May 2013
       - Initial public reception was mixed, with some developers skeptical about the JSX syntax and the approach of mixing markup with JavaScript

       **2014-2015: Growing Adoption**
       - React Native was announced in 2015, extending React's paradigm to mobile app development
       - The ecosystem began to grow with tools like Redux for state management
       - Companies beyond Facebook began adopting React for production applications

       **2016-2018: Maturation**
       - React 16 ("Fiber") was released in 2017 with a complete rewrite of the core architecture
       - Introduction of new features like Error Boundaries, Portals, and improved server-side rendering
       - React 16.3 introduced the Context API for easier state management

       **2019-Present: Modern React**
       - React Hooks were introduced in React 16.8 (February 2019), revolutionizing state management in functional components
       - React 17 (October 2020) focused on making React upgrades easier
       - React 18 (March 2022) introduced concurrent rendering and automatic batching
       - React continues to evolve with Server Components, the new React compiler (React Forget), and other performance improvements
       </details>

       **Note:** JSX, React's syntax extension, was indeed inspired by XHP's approach of embedding XML-like syntax in code.

3.  ### What are the major features of React?

    React offers a powerful set of features that have made it one of the most popular JavaScript libraries for building user interfaces:

    **Core Features:**

    - **Component-Based Architecture**: React applications are built using components - independent, reusable pieces of code that return HTML via a render function. This modular approach enables better code organization, reusability, and maintenance.

    - **Virtual DOM**: React creates an in-memory data structure cache, computes the resulting differences, and efficiently updates only the changed parts in the browser DOM. This approach significantly improves performance compared to direct DOM manipulation.

    - **JSX (JavaScript XML)**: A syntax extension that allows writing HTML-like code in JavaScript. JSX makes the code more readable and expressive while providing the full power of JavaScript.

    - **Unidirectional Data Flow**: React follows a one-way data binding model where data flows from parent to child components. This makes the code more predictable and easier to debug.

    - **Declarative UI**: React allows you to describe what your UI should look like for a given state, and it handles the DOM updates when the underlying data changes.

    **Advanced Features:**

    - **React Hooks**: Introduced in React 16.8, hooks allow using state and other React features in functional components without writing classes.

    - **Context API**: Provides a way to share values between components without explicitly passing props through every level of the component tree.

    - **Error Boundaries**: Components that catch JavaScript errors anywhere in their child component tree and display fallback UI instead of crashing.

    - **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Enables rendering React components on the server before sending HTML to the client, improving performance and SEO.

    - **Concurrent Mode**: A set of new features (in development) that help React apps stay responsive and gracefully adjust to the user's device capabilities and network speed.

    - **React Server Components**: A new feature that allows components to be rendered entirely on the server, reducing bundle size and improving performance.

    - **Suspense**: A feature that lets your components "wait" for something before rendering, supporting code-splitting and data fetching with cleaner code.

    These features collectively make React powerful for building everything from small widgets to complex, large-scale web applications.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

4.  ### What is JSX?

    _JSX_ stands for _JavaScript XML_ and it is an XML-like syntax extension to ECMAScript. Basically it just provides the syntactic sugar for the `React.createElement(type, props, ...children)` function, giving us expressiveness of JavaScript along with HTML like template syntax.

    In the example below, the text inside `<h1>` tag is returned as JavaScript function to the render function.

    ```jsx harmony
    export default function App() {
      return <h1 className="greeting">{"Hello, this is a JSX Code!"}</h1>;
    }
    ```

    If you don't use JSX syntax then the respective JavaScript code should be written as below,

    ```javascript
    import { createElement } from "react";

    export default function App() {
      return createElement(
        "h1",
        { className: "greeting" },
        "Hello, this is a JSX Code!"
      );
    }
    ```

     <details><summary><b>See Class</b></summary>
     <p>

    ```jsx harmony
    class App extends React.Component {
      render() {
        return <h1 className="greeting">{"Hello, this is a JSX Code!"}</h1>;
      }
    }
    ```

     </p>
     </details>

    **Note:** JSX is stricter than HTML

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

5.  ### What is the difference between an Element and a Component?

      **Element:**
      - A React **Element** is a plain JavaScript object that describes what you want to see on the UI. It represents a DOM node or a component at a specific point in time. 
      - Elements are immutable: once created, you cannot change their properties. Instead, you create new elements to reflect updates.
      - Elements can be nested within other elements through their `props`.
      - Creating an element is a fast, lightweight operation—it does **not** create any actual DOM nodes or render anything to the screen directly.

        **Example (without JSX):**
        ```js
        const element = React.createElement("button", { id: "login-btn" }, "Login");
        ```

        **Equivalent JSX syntax:**
        ```jsx
        <button id="login-btn">Login</button>
        ```

        **The object returned by `React.createElement`:**
        ```js
        {
          type: 'button',
          props: {
            id: 'login-btn',
            children: 'Login'
          }
        }
        ```
        Elements are then passed to the React DOM renderer (e.g., `ReactDOM.render()`), which translates them to actual DOM nodes.

        ---

      **Component:**
      - A **Component** is a function or class that returns an element (or a tree of elements) to describe part of the UI. Components can accept inputs (called **props**) and manage their own state (in case of class or function components with hooks).
      - Components allow you to split the UI into independent, reusable pieces, each isolated and composable.
      - You can define a component using a function or a class:

        **Example (Function Component with JSX):**
        ```jsx
        const Button = ({ handleLogin }) => (
          <button id="login-btn" onClick={handleLogin}>
            Login
          </button>
        );
        ```

        When JSX is compiled, it's transformed into a tree of `React.createElement` calls:

        ```js
        const Button = ({ handleLogin }) =>
          React.createElement(
            "button",
            { id: "login-btn", onClick: handleLogin },
            "Login"
          );
        ```

        ---

      **In summary:**
      - **Elements** are the smallest building blocks in React—objects that describe what you want to see.
      - **Components** are functions or classes that return elements and encapsulate logic, structure, and behavior for parts of your UI.

       > Think of **elements** as the instructions for creating UI, and **components** as reusable blueprints that combine logic and structure to generate those instructions.

6.  ### How to create components in React?

    Components are the building blocks of creating User Interfaces(UI) in React. There are two possible ways to create a component.

    1. **Function Components:** This is the simplest way to create a component. Those are pure JavaScript functions that accept props object as the one and only one parameter and return React elements to render the output:

       ```jsx harmony
       function Greeting({ message }) {
         return <h1>{`Hello, ${message}`}</h1>;
       }
       ```

    2. **Class Components:** You can also use ES6 class to define a component. The above function component can be written as a class component:

       ```jsx harmony
       class Greeting extends React.Component {
         render() {
           return <h1>{`Hello, ${this.props.message}`}</h1>;
         }
       }
       ```

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

7.  ### When to use a Class Component over a Function Component?

    After the addition of Hooks(i.e. React 16.8 onwards) it is always recommended to use Function components over Class components in React. Because you could use state, lifecycle methods and other features that were only available in class component present in function component too.

    But even there are two reasons to use Class components over Function components.

    1. If you need a React functionality whose Function component equivalent is not present yet, like Error Boundaries.
    2. In older versions, If the component needs _state or lifecycle methods_ then you need to use class component.

    So the summary to this question is as follows:

    **Use Function Components:**

    - If you don't need state or lifecycle methods, and your component is purely presentational.
    - For simplicity, readability, and modern code practices, especially with the use of React Hooks for state and side effects.

    **Use Class Components:**

    - If you need to manage state or use lifecycle methods.
    - In scenarios where backward compatibility or integration with older code is necessary.

    **Note:** You can also use reusable [react error boundary](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-error-boundary) third-party component without writing any class. i.e, No need to use class components for Error boundaries.

    The usage of Error boundaries from the above library is quite straight forward.

    > **_Note when using react-error-boundary:_** ErrorBoundary is a client component. You can only pass props to it that are serializable or use it in files that have a `"use client";` directive.

    ```jsx
    "use client";

    import { ErrorBoundary } from "react-error-boundary";

    <ErrorBoundary fallback={<div>Something went wrong</div>}>
      <ExampleApplication />
    </ErrorBoundary>;
    ```

8.  ### What are Pure Components?

    Pure components are the components which render the same output for the same state and props. In function components, you can achieve these pure components through memoized `React.memo()` API wrapping around the component. This API prevents unnecessary re-renders by comparing the previous props and new props using shallow comparison. So it will be helpful for performance optimizations.

    But at the same time, it won't compare the previous state with the current state because function component itself prevents the unnecessary rendering by default when you set the same state again.

    The syntactic representation of memoized components looks like below,

    ```jsx
    const MemoizedComponent = memo(SomeComponent, arePropsEqual?);
    ```

    Below is the example of how child component(i.e., EmployeeProfile) prevents re-renders for the same props passed by parent component(i.e.,EmployeeRegForm).

    ```jsx
    import { memo, useState } from "react";

    const EmployeeProfile = memo(function EmployeeProfile({ name, email }) {
      return (
        <>
          <p>Name:{name}</p>
          <p>Email: {email}</p>
        </>
      );
    });
    export default function EmployeeRegForm() {
      const [name, setName] = useState("");
      const [email, setEmail] = useState("");
      return (
        <>
          <label>
            Name:{" "}
            <input value={name} onChange={(e) => setName(e.target.value)} />
          </label>
          <label>
            Email:{" "}
            <input value={email} onChange={(e) => setEmail(e.target.value)} />
          </label>
          <hr />
          <EmployeeProfile name={name} />
        </>
      );
    }
    ```

    In the above code, the email prop has not been passed to child component. So there won't be any re-renders for email prop change.

    In class components, the components extending _`React.PureComponent`_ instead of _`React.Component`_ become the pure components. When props or state changes, _PureComponent_ will do a shallow comparison on both props and state by invoking `shouldComponentUpdate()` lifecycle method.

    **Note:** `React.memo()` is a higher-order component.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

9.  ### What is state in React?

    _State_ of a component is an object that holds some information that may change over the lifetime of the component. The important point is whenever the state object changes, the component re-renders. It is always recommended to make our state as simple as possible and minimize the number of stateful components.

    ![state](images/state.jpg)

    Let's take an example of **User** component with `message` state. Here, **useState** hook has been used to add state to the User component and it returns an array with current state and function to update it.

    ```jsx harmony
    import { useState } from "react";

    function User() {
      const [message, setMessage] = useState("Welcome to React world");

      return (
        <div>
          <h1>{message}</h1>
        </div>
      );
    }
    ```

    Whenever React calls your component or access `useState` hook, it gives you a snapshot of the state for that particular render.

    <details><summary><b>See Class</b></summary>
    <p>

    ```jsx harmony
    import React from "react";
    class User extends React.Component {
      constructor(props) {
        super(props);

        this.state = {
          message: "Welcome to React world",
        };
      }

      render() {
        return (
          <div>
            <h1>{this.state.message}</h1>
          </div>
        );
      }
    }
    ```

    </p>
    </details>

    State is similar to props, but it is private and fully controlled by the component ,i.e., it is not accessible to any other component till the owner component decides to pass it.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

10. ### What are props in React?

    _Props_ are inputs to components. They are single values or objects containing a set of values that are passed to components on creation similar to HTML-tag attributes. Here, the data is passed down from a parent component to a child component.

    The primary purpose of props in React is to provide following component functionality:

    1. Pass custom data to your component.
    2. Trigger state changes.
    3. Use via `this.props.reactProp` inside component's `render()` method.

    For example, let us create an element with `reactProp` property:

    ```jsx harmony
    <Element reactProp={"1"} />
    ```

    This `reactProp` (or whatever you came up with) attribute name then becomes a property attached to React's native props object which originally already exists on all components created using React library.

    ```jsx harmony
    props.reactProp;
    ```

    For example, the usage of props in function component looks like below:

    ```jsx
    import React from "react";
    import ReactDOM from "react-dom";

    const ChildComponent = (props) => {
      return (
        <div>
          <p>{props.name}</p>
          <p>{props.age}</p>
          <p>{props.gender}</p>
        </div>
      );
    };

    const ParentComponent = () => {
      return (
        <div>
          <ChildComponent name="John" age="30" gender="male" />
          <ChildComponent name="Mary" age="25" geneder="female" />
        </div>
      );
    };
    ```

The properties from props object can be accessed directly using destructing feature from ES6 (ECMAScript 2015). It is also possible to fallback to default value when the prop value is not specified. The above child component can be simplified like below.

```jsx harmony
const ChildComponent = ({ name, age, gender = "male" }) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <p>{name}</p>
      <p>{age}</p>
      <p>{gender}</p>
    </div>
  );
};
```

**Note:** The default value won't be used if you pass `null` or `0` value. i.e, default value is only used if the prop value is missed or `undefined` value has been passed.

  <details><summary><b>See Class</b></summary>
     The Props accessed in Class Based Component as below

```jsx
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";

class ChildComponent extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <p>{this.props.name}</p>
        <p>{this.props.age}</p>
        <p>{this.props.gender}</p>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

class ParentComponent extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <ChildComponent name="John" age="30" gender="male" />
        <ChildComponent name="Mary" age="25" gender="female" />
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

  </details>

11. ### What is the difference between state and props?

    In React, both **state** and **props** are plain JavaScript objects, but they serve different purposes and have distinct behaviors:

    ### State
    - **Definition:**  
      State is a data structure that is managed within a component. It represents information that can change over the lifetime of the component.
    - **Mutability:**  
      State is mutable, meaning it can be changed using the setter function (`setState` in class components or the updater function from `useState` in functional components).
    - **Scope:**  
      State is local to the component where it is defined. Only that component can modify its own state.
    - **Usage:**  
      State is typically used for data that needs to change in response to user actions, network responses, or other dynamic events.
    - **Re-rendering:**  
      Updating the state triggers a re-render of the component and its descendants.

    ### Props
    - **Definition:**  
      Props (short for “properties”) are inputs to a component, provided by its parent component.
    - **Mutability:**  
      Props are read-only. A component cannot modify its own props; they are immutable from the component’s perspective.
    - **Scope:**  
      Props are used to pass data and event handlers down the component tree, enabling parent components to configure or communicate with their children.
    - **Usage:**  
      Props are commonly used to make components reusable and configurable. They allow the same component to be rendered with different data or behavior.
    - **Analogy:**  
      Think of props as arguments to a function, whereas state is like variables declared inside the function.

    ### Summary Table

    | Feature   | State                               | Props                             |
    |-----------|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
    | Managed by| The component itself                | Parent component                  |
    | Mutable   | Yes                                 | No (read-only)                    |
    | Scope     | Local to the component              | Passed from parent to child       |
    | Usage     | Manage dynamic data and UI changes  | Configure and customize component |
    | Update    | Using setState/useState             | Cannot be updated by the component|

12. ### What is the difference between HTML and React event handling?

    Below are some of the main differences between HTML and React event handling,

    1. In HTML, the event name usually represents in _lowercase_ as a convention:

       ```html
       <button onclick="activateLasers()"></button>
       ```

       Whereas in React it follows _camelCase_ convention:

       ```jsx harmony
       <button onClick={activateLasers}>
       ```

    2. In HTML, you can return `false` to prevent default behavior:

       ```html
       <a
         href="#"
         onclick='console.log("The link was clicked."); return false;'
       />
       ```

       Whereas in React you must call `preventDefault()` explicitly:

       ```javascript
       function handleClick(event) {
         event.preventDefault();
         console.log("The link was clicked.");
       }
       ```

    3. In HTML, you need to invoke the function by appending `()`
       Whereas in react you should not append `()` with the function name. (refer "activateLasers" function in the first point for example)

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

13. ### What are synthetic events in React?

    `SyntheticEvent` is a cross-browser wrapper around the browser's native event. Its API is same as the browser's native event, including `stopPropagation()` and `preventDefault()`, except the events work identically across all browsers. The native events can be accessed directly from synthetic events using `nativeEvent` attribute.

    Let's take an example of `BookStore` title search component with the ability to get all native event properties

    ```js
    function BookStore() {
      function handleTitleChange(e) {
        console.log("The new title is:", e.target.value);
        console.log('Synthetic event:', e); // React SyntheticEvent
        console.log('Native event:', e.nativeEvent); // Browser native event
        e.stopPropagation();
        e.preventDefault();
      }

      return <input name="title" onChange={handleTitleChange} />;
    }
    ```
    
    List of common synthetic events are:

    *   `onClick`
    *   `onChange`
    *   `onSubmit`
    *   `onKeyDown`, `onKeyUp`
    *   `onFocus`, `onBlur`
    *   `onMouseEnter`, `onMouseLeave`
    *   `onTouchStart`, `onTouchEnd`

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

14. ### What are inline conditional expressions?

    You can use either _if statements_ or _ternary expressions_ which are available in JS(and JSX in React) to conditionally execute or render expressions. Apart from these approaches, you can also embed any expressions in JSX by wrapping them in curly braces and then followed by JS logical operator `&&`. It is helpful to render elements conditionally within a single line and commonly used for concise logic, especially in JSX rendering.

    ```jsx harmony
    <h1>Hello!</h1>;
    {
      messages.length > 0 && !isLogin ? (
        <h2>You have {messages.length} unread messages.</h2>
      ) : (
        <h2>You don't have unread messages.</h2>
      );
    }
    ```

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

15. ### What is "key" prop and what is the benefit of using it in arrays of elements?

    A `key` is a special attribute you **should** include when mapping over arrays to render data. _Key_ prop helps React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed.

    Keys should be unique among its siblings. Most often we use ID from our data as _key_:

    ```jsx harmony
    const todoItems = todos.map((todo) => <li key={todo.id}>{todo.text}</li>);
    ```

    When you don't have stable IDs for rendered items, you may use the item _index_ as a _key_ as a last resort:

    ```jsx harmony
    const todoItems = todos.map((todo, index) => (
      <li key={index}>{todo.text}</li>
    ));
    ```
    **Benefits of key:**
      *   Enables React to **efficiently update and re-render** components.
      *   Prevents unnecessary re-renders by **reusing** components when possible.
      *   Helps **maintain internal state** of list items correctly.

    **Note:**

    1. Using _indexes_ for _keys_ is **not recommended** if the order of items may change. This can negatively impact performance and may cause issues with component state.
    2. If you extract list item as separate component then apply _keys_ on list component instead of `li` tag.
    3. There will be a warning message in the console if the `key` prop is not present on list items.
    4. The key attribute accepts either string or number and internally convert it as string type.
    5. Don't generate the key on the fly something like `key={Math.random()}`. Because the keys will never match up between re-renders and DOM created everytime.

16. ### What is Virtual DOM?

    The _Virtual DOM_ (VDOM) is a lightweight, in-memory representation of _Real DOM_ used by libraries like React to optimize UI rendering. The representation of a UI is kept in memory and synced with the "real" DOM. It's a step that happens between the render function being called and the displaying of elements on the screen. This entire process is called _reconciliation_.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

17. ### How Virtual DOM works?

    The _Virtual DOM_ works in five simple steps.

    **1. Initial Render**  
        When a UI component renders for the first time, it returns JSX. React uses this structure to create a Virtual DOM tree, which is a lightweight copy of the actual DOM. This Virtual DOM is then used to build and render the Real DOM in the browser.

    **2. State or Props Change**  
        When the component's state or props change, React creates a new Virtual DOM reflecting the updated UI. However, it doesn't immediately update the Real DOM; instead, it works in memory to prepare for an efficient update.
               
      ![vdom](images/vdom1.png)

    **3. Diffing Algorithm**  
        React then compares the new Virtual DOM with the previous one using a process called diffing. It determines what has changed between the two versions and identifies the minimal set of updates needed.
       
       ![vdom2](images/vdom2.png)  

    **4. Reconciliation**  
        Based on the diffing results, React decides which parts of the Real DOM should be updated. It avoids re-rendering the entire DOM and instead updates only the elements that actually changed.
        
       ![vdom3](images/vdom3.png)

    **5. Efficient DOM Updates**  
        This entire process—working with the Virtual DOM, diffing, and selective updating—makes the UI rendering much faster and more efficient than manipulating the Real DOM directly.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

18. ### What is the difference between Shadow DOM and Virtual DOM?

    The _Shadow DOM_ is a browser technology designed primarily for scoping variables and CSS in _web components_. The _Virtual DOM_ is a concept implemented by libraries in JavaScript on top of browser APIs.

    The key differences in a table format shown below:

    | Feature | Shadow DOM | Virtual DOM |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | Purpose | Encapsulation for Web Components | Efficient UI rendering |
    | Managed by | Browser | JS frameworks (e.g., React) |
    | DOM Type | Part of real DOM (scoped) | In-memory representation |
    | Encapsulation | Yes | No |
    | Use Case | Web Components, scoped styling | UI diffing and minimal DOM updates |

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

19. ### What is React Fiber?

    **React Fiber** is the **new reconciliation engine** in React, introduced in React 16. It’s a complete rewrite of React’s core algorithm(old stack-based algorithm) for rendering and updating the UI. Fiber enhances React’s ability to handle **asynchronous rendering**, **prioritized updates**(assign priority to different types of updates), and **interruption**(ability to pause, abort, or reuse work) of rendering work, enabling smoother and more responsive user interfaces.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

20. ### What is the main goal of React Fiber?

    The goal of _React Fiber_ is to increase its suitability for areas like animation, layout, and gestures. Its headline feature is **incremental rendering**: the ability to split rendering work into chunks and spread it out over multiple frames.

    Its main goals are:

    *   **Incremental Rendering** – Breaks work into chunks for smoother updates.
    *   **Interruptible Rendering** – Pauses and resumes rendering to keep the UI responsive.
    *   **Prioritization** – Handles high-priority updates (e.g. animations) before low-priority ones.
    *   **Concurrency Support** – Enables working on multiple UI versions simultaneously.
    *   **Better Error Handling** – Supports component-level error boundaries.
    *   **Suspense Support** – Allows waiting for async data before rendering.
    *   **Improved DevTools** – Enables better debugging and performance tracking.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

21. ### What are controlled components?

    A **controlled component** is a React component that **fully manages the form element's state**(e.g, elements like `<input>`, `<textarea>`, or `<select>`))  using React's internal state mechanism. i.e, The component does not manage its own internal state — instead, React acts as the single source of truth for form data.

    The controlled components will be implemented using the below steps,

    1. Initialize the state using `useState` hooks in function components or inside constructor for class components.
    2. Set the value of the form element to the respective state variable.
    3. Create an event handler(`onChange`) to handle the user input changes through `useState`'s updater function or `setState` from class component.
    4. Attach the above event handler to form element's change or click events

    **Note:** React re-renders the component every time the input value changes.

   For example, the name input field updates the username using `handleChange` event handler as below,

   ```javascript
   import React, { useState } from "react";

   function UserProfile() {
     const [username, setUsername] = useState("");

     const handleChange = (e) => {
       setUsername(e.target.value);
     };

     return (
       <form>
         <label>
           Name:
           <input type="text" value={username} onChange={handleChange} />
         </label>
       </form>
     );
   }
   ```
   In these components, DOM does not hold the actual data instead React does.
   
   **Benefits:**

   *   Easy to implement **validation**, **conditional formatting**, or **live feedback**.
   *   Full control over form data.
   *   Easier to test and debug because the data is centralized in the component’s state.

   **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

22. ### What are uncontrolled components?
    The **Uncontrolled components** are form elements (like `<input>`, `<textarea>`, or `<select>`) that **manage their own state internally** via the **DOM**, rather than through React state.
    You can query the DOM using a `ref` to find its current value when you need it. This is a bit more like traditional HTML.

    The uncontrolled components will be implemented using the below steps,

    1. Create a ref using `useRef` react hook in function component or `React.createRef()` in class based component.
    2. Attach this `ref` to the form element.
    3. The form element value can be accessed directly through `ref` in event handlers or `componentDidMount` for class components

    In the below UserProfile component, the `username` input is accessed using ref.

    ```jsx harmony
    import React, { useRef } from "react";

    function UserProfile() {
      const usernameRef = useRef(null);

      const handleSubmit = (event) => {
        event.preventDefault();
        console.log("The submitted username is: " + usernameRef.current.value);
      };

      return (
        <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
          <label>
            Username:
            <input type="text" ref={usernameRef} />
          </label>
          <button type="submit">Submit</button>
        </form>
      );
    }
    ```
    **Note:** Here, DOM is in charge of the value. React only accesses the value when needed (via `ref`).

    **Benefits:**
     *   **Less boilerplate** — no need for `useState` and `onChange`.
     *   Useful for **quick form setups** or when integrating with **non-React code**.
     *   Slightly better **performance** in very large forms (fewer re-renders).

    In most cases, it's recommend to use controlled components to implement forms. In a controlled component, form data is handled by a React component. The alternative is uncontrolled components, where form data is handled by the DOM itself.

    <details><summary><b>See Class</b></summary>
    <p>

    ```jsx harmony
    class UserProfile extends React.Component {
      constructor(props) {
        super(props);
        this.handleSubmit = this.handleSubmit.bind(this);
        this.input = React.createRef();
      }

      handleSubmit(event) {
        alert("A name was submitted: " + this.input.current.value);
        event.preventDefault();
      }

      render() {
        return (
          <form onSubmit={this.handleSubmit}>
            <label>
              {"Name:"}
              <input type="text" ref={this.input} />
            </label>
            <input type="submit" value="Submit" />
          </form>
        );
      }
    }
    ```

    </p>
    </details>

23. ### What is the difference between createElement and cloneElement?
    Both `React.createElement` and `React.cloneElement` are used to work with React elements, but they serve different purposes.

    #### **createElement:** 
    Creates a new React element from scratch. JSX elements will be transpiled to `React.createElement()` functions to create React elements which are going to be used for the object representation of UI.
    **Syntax:**
    ```jsx
    React.createElement(type, props, ...children)
    ```
    **Example:**
    ```jsx
    React.createElement('button', { className: 'btn' }, 'Click Me')
    ```
    #### **cloneElement:**
     The `cloneElement` method is used to clone an existing React element and optionally adds or overrides props.

    **Syntax:**
    ```jsx
    React.cloneElement(element, newProps, ...children)
    ```
    **Example:**
    ```jsx
    const button = <button className="btn">Click Me</button>;
    const cloned = React.cloneElement(button, { className: 'btn-primary' });
    // Result: <button className="btn-primary">Click Me</button>
    ```

24. ### What is Lifting State Up in React?

    When several components need to share the same changing data then it is recommended to _lift the shared state up_ to their closest common ancestor. That means if two child components share the same data from its parent, then move the state to parent instead of maintaining local state in both of the child components.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

25. ### What are Higher-Order Components?

    A _higher-order component_ (_HOC_) is a function that takes a component and returns a new enhanced component with additional props, behavior, or data. It’s a design pattern based on React’s compositional nature, allowing you to reuse logic across multiple components without modifying their internals.

    We consider HOCs **pure components** because they don’t mutate or copy behavior from the original component—they simply **wrap it**, enhance it, and pass through the necessary props. The wrapped component remains decoupled and reusable.

    ```javascript
    const EnhancedComponent = higherOrderComponent(WrappedComponent);
    ```
    Let's take an example of a `withAuth` higher-order component (HOC) in React. This HOC will check if a user is authenticated and either render the wrapped component if authenticated or redirect (or show a message) if not.

    **withAuth HOC Example:**
    ```jsx
    import React from 'react';
    import { Navigate } from 'react-router-dom'; // For redirection (assuming React Router v6)

    const isAuthenticated = () => {
      // e.g., check for a valid token in localStorage or context
      return !!localStorage.getItem('authToken');
    };

    function withAuth(WrappedComponent) {
      return function AuthenticatedComponent(props) {
        if (!isAuthenticated()) {
          // User is NOT authenticated, redirect to login page
          return <Navigate to="/login" replace />;
        }

        // User is authenticated, render the wrapped component
        return <WrappedComponent {...props} />;
      };
    }

    export default withAuth;
    ```
    **Usage**
    ```jsx
    import React from 'react';
    import withAuth from './withAuth';

    function Dashboard() {
      return <h1>Welcome to the Dashboard!</h1>;
    }

    // Wrap Dashboard with withAuth HOC
    export default withAuth(Dashboard);
    ```

    HOC can be used for many use cases:

    1. Code reuse, logic and bootstrap abstraction (e.g., fetching data, permissions, theming).
    2. Render hijacking (e.g., conditional rendering or layout changes).
    3. State abstraction and manipulation(e.g., handling form logic).
    4. Props manipulation(e.g., injecting additional props or filtering them).
    
    Some of the real-world examples of HOCs in react eco-system:
    1. connect() from react-redux
    2. withRouter() from React Router v5
    3. withTranslation() from react-i18next
    4. withApollo() from Apollo client
    5. withFormik from Formik library
    6. withTheme from styled components

26. ### What is children prop?
    The `children` prop is a special prop in React used to pass elements between the opening and closing tags of a component. It is commonly used in layout and wrapper componnents. 

    A simple usage of children prop looks as below,

    ```jsx harmony
    function MyDiv({ children }){
        return (
          <div>
            {children}
          </div>;
        );
    }

    export default function Greeting() {
      return (
        <MyDiv>
          <span>{"Hello"}</span>
          <span>{"World"}</span>
        </MyDiv>
      );
    }
    ```
    Here, everything inside `<MyDiv>...</MyDiv>` is passed as children to the custom div component.

    The children can be text, JSX elements, fragments, arrays and functions(for advance use case like render props).

    <details><summary><b>See Class</b></summary>
    <p>

    ```jsx harmony
    const MyDiv = React.createClass({
      render: function () {
        return <div>{this.props.children}</div>;
      },
    });

    ReactDOM.render(
      <MyDiv>
        <span>{"Hello"}</span>
        <span>{"World"}</span>
      </MyDiv>,
      node
    );
    ```

    </p>
    </details>

    **Note:** There are several methods available in the legacy React API to work with this prop. These include `React.Children.map`, `React.Children.forEach`, `React.Children.count`, `React.Children.only`, `React.Children.toArray`.

27. ### How to write comments in React?

    The comments in React/JSX are similar to JavaScript Multiline comments but are wrapped in curly braces.

    **Single-line comments:**

    ```jsx harmony
    <div>
      {/* Single-line comments(In vanilla JavaScript, the single-line comments are represented by double slash(//)) */}
      {`Welcome ${user}, let's play React`}
    </div>
    ```

    **Multi-line comments:**

    ```jsx harmony
    <div>
      {/* Multi-line comments for more than
       one line */}
      {`Welcome ${user}, let's play React`}
    </div>
    ```

    You can use `//` and `/* */` in JS logic, hooks, and functions.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

28. ### What is reconciliation?

    `Reconciliation` is the process through which React updates the Browser DOM and makes React work faster. React use a `diffing algorithm` so that component updates are predictable and faster. React would first calculate the difference between the `real DOM` and the copy of DOM `(Virtual DOM)` when there's an update of components.
    React stores a copy of Browser DOM which is called `Virtual DOM`. When we make changes or add data, React creates a new Virtual DOM and compares it with the previous one. This comparison is done by `Diffing Algorithm`.
    Now React compares the Virtual DOM with Real DOM. It finds out the changed nodes and updates only the changed nodes in Real DOM leaving the rest nodes as it is. This process is called _Reconciliation_.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

29. ### Does the lazy function support named exports?

    No, currently `React.lazy` function supports default exports only. If you would like to import modules which are named exports, you can create an intermediate module that reexports it as the default. It also ensures that tree shaking keeps working and don’t pull unused components.
    Let's take a component file which exports multiple named components,

    ```javascript
    // MoreComponents.js
    export const SomeComponent = /* ... */;
    export const UnusedComponent = /* ... */;
    ```

    and reexport `MoreComponents.js` components in an intermediate file `IntermediateComponent.js`

    ```javascript
    // IntermediateComponent.js
    export { SomeComponent as default } from "./MoreComponents.js";
    ```

    Now you can import the module using lazy function as below,

    ```javascript
    import React, { lazy } from "react";
    const SomeComponent = lazy(() => import("./IntermediateComponent.js"));
    ```

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

30. ### Why React uses `className` over `class` attribute?

    React uses **className** instead of **class** because of a JavaScript naming conflict with the class keyword.

    1. `class` is a reserved keyword in JavaScript
        In JavaScript, class is used to define ES6 classes:
      
        ```js
        class Person {
          constructor(name) {
            this.name = name;
          }
        }
        ```
        If you try to use class as a variable or property name, it will throw a syntax error. Since JSX is just JavaScript with XML-like syntax, using class directly in JSX would break the parser.

    2. JSX Is JavaScript
    
        When you write JSX like this:
        ```jsx
        <div class="btn">Click</div>
        ```
        It will be compiled to:
        ```jsx
        React.createElement('div', { class: 'btn' }, 'Click');
        ```
        But `class` is invalid in this object literal context (since it clashes with the JS keyword), hence React instead uses className.
        ```jsx
        <div className="btn">Click</div>
        ```
        which compiles to:
        ```jsx
        React.createElement('div', { className: 'btn' }, 'Click');
        ```
        React then translates `className` to` class` in the final HTML DOM.

    3. Aligns with DOM APIs
        In vanilla JavaScript, you interact with element classes using:
        ```js
        element.className = 'my-class';
        ```
        React follows this convention, staying consistent with the DOM API's property name rather than HTML’s attribute.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

31. ### What are fragments?

    It's a common pattern or practice in React for a component to return multiple elements. _Fragments_ let you group a list of children without adding extra nodes to the DOM.
    You need to use either `<Fragment>` or a shorter syntax having empty tag (`<></>`).

    Below is the example of how to use fragment inside _Story_ component.

    ```jsx harmony
    function Story({ title, description, date }) {
      return (
        <Fragment>
          <h2>{title}</h2>
          <p>{description}</p>
          <p>{date}</p>
        </Fragment>
      );
    }
    ```

    It is also possible to render list of fragments inside a loop with the mandatory **key** attribute supplied.

    ```jsx harmony
    function StoryBook() {
      return stories.map((story) => (
        <Fragment key={story.id}>
          <h2>{story.title}</h2>
          <p>{story.description}</p>
          <p>{story.date}</p>
        </Fragment>
      ));
    }
    ```

    Usually, you don't need to use `<Fragment>` until there is a need of _key_ attribute. The usage of shorter syntax looks like below.

    ```jsx harmony
    function Story({ title, description, date }) {
      return (
        <>
          <h2>{title}</h2>
          <p>{description}</p>
          <p>{date}</p>
        </>
      );
    }
    ```

32. ### Why fragments are better than container divs?

    Below are the list of reasons to prefer fragments over container DOM elements,

    1. Fragments are a bit faster and use less memory by not creating an extra DOM node. This only has a real benefit on very large and deep trees.
    2. Some CSS mechanisms like _Flexbox_ and _CSS Grid_ have a special parent-child relationships, and adding divs in the middle makes it hard to keep the desired layout.
    3. The DOM Inspector is less cluttered.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

33. ### What are portals in React?

    A Portal is a React feature that enables rendering children into a DOM node that exists outside the parent component's DOM hierarchy, while still preserving the React component hierarchy. Portals help avoid CSS stacking issues—for example, elements with position: fixed may not behave as expected inside a parent with transform. Portals solve this by rendering content (like modals or tooltips) outside such constrained DOM contexts.

    ```javascript
    ReactDOM.createPortal(child, container);
    ```
    *   `child`: Any valid React node (e.g., JSX, string, fragment).
    *   `container`: A real DOM node (e.g., `document.getElementById('modal-root')`).

    Even though the content renders elsewhere in the DOM, it still behaves like a normal child in React. It has access to context, state, and event handling.

    **Example:- Modal:**
    ```jsx
    function Modal({ children }) {
      return ReactDOM.createPortal(
        <div className="modal">{children}</div>,
        document.body)
      );
    }
    ```
    The above code will render the modal content into the body element in the HTML, not inside the component's usual location.

34. ### What are stateless components?

    If the behaviour of a component is independent of its state then it can be a stateless component. You can use either a function or a class for creating stateless components. But unless you need to use a lifecycle hook in your components, you should go for function components. There are a lot of benefits if you decide to use function components here; they are easy to write, understand, and test, a little faster, and you can avoid the `this` keyword altogether.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

35. ### What are stateful components?

    If the behaviour of a component is dependent on the _state_ of the component then it can be termed as stateful component. These _stateful components_ are either function components with hooks or _class components_.

    Let's take an example of function stateful component which update the state based on click event,

    ```javascript
    import React, {useState} from 'react';

    const App = (props) => {
    const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
    handleIncrement() {
      setCount(count+1);
    }

    return (
      <>
        <button onClick={handleIncrement}>Increment</button>
        <span>Counter: {count}</span>
      </>
      )
    }
    ```

    <details><summary><b>See Class</b></summary>
    <p>
    The equivalent class stateful component with a state that gets initialized in the `constructor`.

    ```jsx harmony
    class App extends Component {
      constructor(props) {
        super(props);
        this.state = { count: 0 };
      }

      handleIncrement() {
        setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 });
      }

      render() {
        <>
          <button onClick={() => this.handleIncrement}>Increment</button>
          <span>Count: {count}</span>
        </>;
      }
    }
    ```

    </p>
    </details>

36. ### How to apply validation on props in React?

    When the application is running in _development mode_, React will automatically check all props that we set on components to make sure they have _correct type_. If the type is incorrect, React will generate warning messages in the console. It's disabled in _production mode_ due to performance impact. The mandatory props are defined with `isRequired`.

    The set of predefined prop types:

    1. `PropTypes.number`
    2. `PropTypes.string`
    3. `PropTypes.array`
    4. `PropTypes.object`
    5. `PropTypes.func`
    6. `PropTypes.node`
    7. `PropTypes.element`
    8. `PropTypes.bool`
    9. `PropTypes.symbol`
    10. `PropTypes.any`

    We can define `propTypes` for `User` component as below:

    ```jsx harmony
    import React from "react";
    import PropTypes from "prop-types";

    class User extends React.Component {
      static propTypes = {
        name: PropTypes.string.isRequired,
        age: PropTypes.number.isRequired,
      };

      render() {
        return (
          <>
            <h1>{`Welcome, ${this.props.name}`}</h1>
            <h2>{`Age, ${this.props.age}`}</h2>
          </>
        );
      }
    }
    ```

    **Note:** In React v15.5 _PropTypes_ were moved from `React.PropTypes` to `prop-types` library.

    _The Equivalent Functional Component_

    ```jsx harmony
    import React from "react";
    import PropTypes from "prop-types";

    function User({ name, age }) {
      return (
        <>
          <h1>{`Welcome, ${name}`}</h1>
          <h2>{`Age, ${age}`}</h2>
        </>
      );
    }

    User.propTypes = {
      name: PropTypes.string.isRequired,
      age: PropTypes.number.isRequired,
    };
    ```

37. ### What are the advantages of React?

    Below are the list of main advantages of React,

    1. Increases the application's performance with _Virtual DOM_.
    2. JSX makes code easy to read and write.
    3. It renders both on client and server side (_SSR_).
    4. Easy to integrate with frameworks (Angular, Backbone) since it is only a view library.
    5. Easy to write unit and integration tests with tools such as Jest.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

38. ### What are the limitations of React?

    Apart from the advantages, there are few limitations of React too,

    1. React is just a view library, not a full framework.
    2. There is a learning curve for beginners who are new to web development.
    3. Integrating React into a traditional MVC framework requires some additional configuration.
    4. The code complexity increases with inline templating and JSX.
    5. Too many smaller components leading to over engineering or boilerplate.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

39. ### What are the recommended ways for static type checking?

    Normally we use _PropTypes library_ (`React.PropTypes` moved to a `prop-types` package since React v15.5) for _type checking_ in the React applications. For large code bases, it is recommended to use _static type checkers_ such as Flow or TypeScript, that perform type checking at compile time and provide auto-completion features.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

40. ### What is the use of `react-dom` package?

    The `react-dom` package provides _DOM-specific methods_ that can be used at the top level of your app. Most of the components are not required to use this module. Some of the methods of this package are:

    1. `render()`
    2. `hydrate()`
    3. `unmountComponentAtNode()`
    4. `findDOMNode()`
    5. `createPortal()`

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

41. ### What is ReactDOMServer?

    The `ReactDOMServer` object enables you to render components to static markup (typically used on node server). This object is mainly used for _server-side rendering_ (SSR). The following methods can be used in both the server and browser environments:

    1. `renderToString()`
    2. `renderToStaticMarkup()`

    For example, you generally run a Node-based web server like Express, Hapi, or Koa, and you call `renderToString` to render your root component to a string, which you then send as response.

    ```javascript
    // using Express
    import { renderToString } from "react-dom/server";
    import MyPage from "./MyPage";

    app.get("/", (req, res) => {
      res.write(
        "<!DOCTYPE html><html><head><title>My Page</title></head><body>"
      );
      res.write('<div id="content">');
      res.write(renderToString(<MyPage />));
      res.write("</div></body></html>");
      res.end();
    });
    ```

42. ### How to use innerHTML in React?

    The `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` attribute is React's replacement for using `innerHTML` in the browser DOM. Just like `innerHTML`, it is risky to use this attribute considering cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. You just need to pass a `__html` object as key and HTML text as value.

    In this example MyComponent uses `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` attribute for setting HTML markup:

    ```jsx harmony
    function createMarkup() {
      return { __html: "First &middot; Second" };
    }

    function MyComponent() {
      return <div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={createMarkup()} />;
    }
    ```

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

43. ### How to use styles in React?

    The `style` attribute accepts a JavaScript object with camelCased properties rather than a CSS string. This is consistent with the DOM style JavaScript property, is more efficient, and prevents XSS security holes.

    ```jsx harmony
    const divStyle = {
      color: "blue",
      backgroundImage: "url(" + imgUrl + ")",
    };

    function HelloWorldComponent() {
      return <div style={divStyle}>Hello World!</div>;
    }
    ```

    Style keys are camelCased in order to be consistent with accessing the properties on DOM nodes in JavaScript (e.g. `node.style.backgroundImage`).

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

44. ### How events are different in React?

    Handling events in React elements has some syntactic differences:

    1. React event handlers are named using camelCase, rather than lowercase.
    2. With JSX you pass a function as the event handler, rather than a string.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

45. ### What is the impact of indexes as keys?

    Keys should be stable, predictable, and unique so that React can keep track of elements.

    In the below code snippet each element's key will be based on ordering, rather than tied to the data that is being represented. This limits the optimizations that React can do and creates confusing bugs in the application.

    ```jsx harmony
    {
      todos.map((todo, index) => <Todo {...todo} key={index} />);
    }
    ```

    If you use element data for unique key, assuming `todo.id` is unique to this list and stable, React would be able to reorder elements without needing to reevaluate them as much.

    ```jsx harmony
    {
      todos.map((todo) => <Todo {...todo} key={todo.id} />);
    }
    ```

    **Note:** If you don't specify `key` prop at all, React will use index as a key's value while iterating over an array of data.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

46. ### How do you conditionally render components?

    In some cases you want to render different components depending on some state. JSX does not render `false` or `undefined`, so you can use conditional _short-circuiting_ to render a given part of your component only if a certain condition is true.

    ```jsx harmony
    const MyComponent = ({ name, address }) => (
      <div>
        <h2>{name}</h2>
        {address && <p>{address}</p>}
      </div>
    );
    ```

    If you need an `if-else` condition then use _ternary operator_.

    ```jsx harmony
    const MyComponent = ({ name, address }) => (
      <div>
        <h2>{name}</h2>
        {address ? <p>{address}</p> : <p>{"Address is not available"}</p>}
      </div>
    );
    ```

47. ### Why we need to be careful when spreading props on DOM elements?

    When we _spread props_ we run into the risk of adding unknown HTML attributes, which is a bad practice. Instead we can use prop destructuring with `...rest` operator, so it will add only required props.

    For example,

    ```jsx harmony
    const ComponentA = () => (
      <ComponentB isDisplay={true} className={"componentStyle"} />
    );

    const ComponentB = ({ isDisplay, ...domProps }) => (
      <div {...domProps}>{"ComponentB"}</div>
    );
    ```

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

48. ### How do you memoize a component?

    There are memoize libraries available which can be used on function components.

    For example `moize` library can memoize the component in another component.

    ```jsx harmony
    import moize from "moize";
    import Component from "./components/Component"; // this module exports a non-memoized component

    const MemoizedFoo = moize.react(Component);

    const Consumer = () => {
      <div>
        {"I will memoize the following entry:"}
        <MemoizedFoo />
      </div>;
    };
    ```

    **Update:** Since React v16.6.0, we have a `React.memo`. It provides a higher order component which memoizes component unless the props change. To use it, simply wrap the component using React.memo before you use it.

    ```js
    const MemoComponent = React.memo(function MemoComponent(props) {
      /* render using props */
    });
    OR;
    export default React.memo(MyFunctionComponent);
    ```

49. ### How you implement Server Side Rendering or SSR?

    React is already equipped to handle rendering on Node servers. A special version of the DOM renderer is available, which follows the same pattern as on the client side.

    ```jsx harmony
    import ReactDOMServer from "react-dom/server";
    import App from "./App";

    ReactDOMServer.renderToString(<App />);
    ```

    This method will output the regular HTML as a string, which can be then placed inside a page body as part of the server response. On the client side, React detects the pre-rendered content and seamlessly picks up where it left off.

50. ### How to enable production mode in React?

    You should use Webpack's `DefinePlugin` method to set `NODE_ENV` to `production`, by which it strip out things like propType validation and extra warnings. Apart from this, if you minify the code, for example, Uglify's dead-code elimination to strip out development only code and comments, it will drastically reduce the size of your bundle.

51. ### Do Hooks replace render props and higher order components?

    Both render props and higher-order components render only a single child but in most of the cases Hooks are a simpler way to serve this by reducing nesting in your tree.

52. ### What is a switching component?

    A _switching component_ is a component that renders one of many components. We need to use object to map prop values to components.

    For example, a switching component to display different pages based on `page` prop:

    ```jsx harmony
    import HomePage from "./HomePage";
    import AboutPage from "./AboutPage";
    import ServicesPage from "./ServicesPage";
    import ContactPage from "./ContactPage";

    const PAGES = {
      home: HomePage,
      about: AboutPage,
      services: ServicesPage,
      contact: ContactPage,
    };

    const Page = (props) => {
      const Handler = PAGES[props.page] || ContactPage;

      return <Handler {...props} />;
    };

    // The keys of the PAGES object can be used in the prop types to catch dev-time errors.
    Page.propTypes = {
      page: PropTypes.oneOf(Object.keys(PAGES)).isRequired,
    };
    ```

53. ### What are React Mixins?

    _Mixins_ are a way to totally separate components to have a common functionality. Mixins **should not be used** and can be replaced with _higher-order components_ or _decorators_.

    One of the most commonly used mixins is `PureRenderMixin`. You might be using it in some components to prevent unnecessary re-renders when the props and state are shallowly equal to the previous props and state:

    ```javascript
    const PureRenderMixin = require("react-addons-pure-render-mixin");

    const Button = React.createClass({
      mixins: [PureRenderMixin],
      // ...
    });
    ```

     <!-- TODO: mixins are deprecated -->

54. ### What are the Pointer Events supported in React?

    _Pointer Events_ provide a unified way of handling all input events. In the old days we had a mouse and respective event listeners to handle them but nowadays we have many devices which don't correlate to having a mouse, like phones with touch surface or pens. We need to remember that these events will only work in browsers that support the _Pointer Events_ specification.

    The following event types are now available in _React DOM_:

    1. `onPointerDown`
    2. `onPointerMove`
    3. `onPointerUp`
    4. `onPointerCancel`
    5. `onGotPointerCapture`
    6. `onLostPointerCapture`
    7. `onPointerEnter`
    8. `onPointerLeave`
    9. `onPointerOver`
    10. `onPointerOut`

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

55. ### Why should component names start with capital letter?

    If you are rendering your component using JSX, the name of that component has to begin with a capital letter otherwise React will throw an error as an unrecognized tag. This convention is because only HTML elements and SVG tags can begin with a lowercase letter.

    ```jsx harmony
    function SomeComponent {
      // Code goes here
    }
    ```

    You can define function component whose name starts with lowercase letter, but when it's imported it should have a capital letter. Here lowercase is fine:

    ```jsx harmony
    function myComponent {
      render() {
        return <div />;
      }
    }

    export default myComponent;
    ```

    While when imported in another file it should start with capital letter:

    ```jsx harmony
    import MyComponent from "./myComponent";
    ```

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

56. ### Are custom DOM attributes supported in React v16?

    Yes. In the past, React used to ignore unknown DOM attributes. If you wrote JSX with an attribute that React doesn't recognize, React would just skip it.

    For example, let's take a look at the below attribute:

    ```jsx harmony
    <div mycustomattribute={"something"} />
    ```

    Would render an empty div to the DOM with React v15:

    ```html
    <div />
    ```

    In React v16 any unknown attributes will end up in the DOM:

    ```html
    <div mycustomattribute="something" />
    ```

    This is useful for supplying browser-specific non-standard attributes, trying new DOM APIs, and integrating with opinionated third-party libraries.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

57. ### How to loop inside JSX?

    You can simply use `Array.prototype.map` with ES6 _arrow function_ syntax.

    For example, the `items` array of objects is mapped into an array of components:

    ```jsx harmony
    <tbody>
      {items.map((item) => (
        <SomeComponent key={item.id} name={item.name} />
      ))}
    </tbody>
    ```

    But you can't iterate using `for` loop:

    ```jsx harmony
    <tbody>
      for (let i = 0; i < items.length; i++) {
        <SomeComponent key={items[i].id} name={items[i].name} />
      }
    </tbody>
    ```

    This is because JSX tags are transpiled into _function calls_, and you can't use statements inside expressions. This may change thanks to `do` expressions which are _stage 1 proposal_.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

58. ### How do you access props in attribute quotes?

    React (or JSX) doesn't support variable interpolation inside an attribute value. The below representation won't work:

    ```jsx harmony
    <img className="image" src="images/{this.props.image}" />
    ```

    But you can put any JS expression inside curly braces as the entire attribute value. So the below expression works:

    ```jsx harmony
    <img className="image" src={"images/" + this.props.image} />
    ```

    Using _template strings_ will also work:

    ```jsx harmony
    <img className="image" src={`images/${this.props.image}`} />
    ```

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

59. ### What is React proptype array with shape?

    If you want to pass an array of objects to a component with a particular shape then use `React.PropTypes.shape()` as an argument to `React.PropTypes.arrayOf()`.

    ```javascript
    ReactComponent.propTypes = {
      arrayWithShape: React.PropTypes.arrayOf(
        React.PropTypes.shape({
          color: React.PropTypes.string.isRequired,
          fontSize: React.PropTypes.number.isRequired,
        })
      ).isRequired,
    };
    ```

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

60. ### How to conditionally apply class attributes?

    You shouldn't use curly braces inside quotes because it is going to be evaluated as a string.

    ```jsx harmony
    <div className="btn-panel {this.props.visible ? 'show' : 'hidden'}">
    ```

    Instead you need to move curly braces outside (don't forget to include spaces between class names):

    ```jsx harmony
    <div className={'btn-panel ' + (this.props.visible ? 'show' : 'hidden')}>
    ```

    _Template strings_ will also work:

    ```jsx harmony
    <div className={`btn-panel ${this.props.visible ? 'show' : 'hidden'}`}>
    ```

61. ### What is the difference between React and ReactDOM?

    The `react` package contains `React.createElement()`, `React.Component`, `React.Children`, and other helpers related to elements and component classes. You can think of these as the isomorphic or universal helpers that you need to build components. The `react-dom` package contains `ReactDOM.render()`, and in `react-dom/server` we have _server-side rendering_ support with `ReactDOMServer.renderToString()` and `ReactDOMServer.renderToStaticMarkup()`.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

62. ### Why ReactDOM is separated from React?

    The React team worked on extracting all DOM-related features into a separate library called _ReactDOM_. React v0.14 is the first release in which the libraries are split. By looking at some of the packages, `react-native`, `react-art`, `react-canvas`, and `react-three`, it has become clear that the beauty and essence of React has nothing to do with browsers or the DOM.

    To build more environments that React can render to, React team planned to split the main React package into two: `react` and `react-dom`. This paves the way to writing components that can be shared between the web version of React and React Native.

63. ### How to use React label element?

    If you try to render a `<label>` element bound to a text input using the standard `for` attribute, then it produces HTML missing that attribute and prints a warning to the console.

    ```jsx harmony
    <label for={'user'}>{'User'}</label>
    <input type={'text'} id={'user'} />
    ```

    Since `for` is a reserved keyword in JavaScript, use `htmlFor` instead.

    ```jsx harmony
    <label htmlFor={'user'}>{'User'}</label>
    <input type={'text'} id={'user'} />
    ```

64. ### How to combine multiple inline style objects?

    You can use _spread operator_ in regular React:

    ```jsx harmony
    <button style={{ ...styles.panel.button, ...styles.panel.submitButton }}>
      {"Submit"}
    </button>
    ```

    If you're using React Native then you can use the array notation:

    ```jsx harmony
    <button style={[styles.panel.button, styles.panel.submitButton]}>
      {"Submit"}
    </button>
    ```

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

65. ### How to re-render the view when the browser is resized?

    You can use the `useState` hook to manage the width and height state variables, and the `useEffect` hook to add and remove the `resize` event listener. The `[]` dependency array passed to useEffect ensures that the effect only runs once (on mount) and not on every re-render.

    ```javascript
    import React, { useState, useEffect } from "react";
    function WindowDimensions() {
      const [dimensions, setDimensions] = useState({
        width: window.innerWidth,
        height: window.innerHeight,
      });

      useEffect(() => {
        function handleResize() {
          setDimensions({
            width: window.innerWidth,
            height: window.innerHeight,
          });
        }
        window.addEventListener("resize", handleResize);
        return () => window.removeEventListener("resize", handleResize);
      }, []);

      return (
        <span>
          {dimensions.width} x {dimensions.height}
        </span>
      );
    }
    ```

    <details>
    <summary><h4>Using Class Component</h4></summary>

    You can listen to the `resize` event in `componentDidMount()` and then update the dimensions (`width` and `height`). You should remove the listener in `componentWillUnmount()` method.

    ```javascript
    class WindowDimensions extends React.Component {
      constructor(props) {
        super(props);
        this.updateDimensions = this.updateDimensions.bind(this);
      }

      componentWillMount() {
        this.updateDimensions();
      }

      componentDidMount() {
        window.addEventListener("resize", this.updateDimensions);
      }

      componentWillUnmount() {
        window.removeEventListener("resize", this.updateDimensions);
      }

      updateDimensions() {
        this.setState({
          width: window.innerWidth,
          height: window.innerHeight,
        });
      }

      render() {
        return (
          <span>
            {this.state.width} x {this.state.height}
          </span>
        );
      }
    }
    ```

66. ### How to pretty print JSON with React?

    We can use `<pre>` tag so that the formatting of the `JSON.stringify()` is retained:

    ```jsx harmony
    const data = { name: "John", age: 42 };

    function User {
        return <pre>{JSON.stringify(data, null, 2)}</pre>;
    }

    const container = createRoot(document.getElementById("container"));

    container.render(<User />);
    ```

      <details><summary><b>See Class</b></summary>
      <p>

    ```jsx harmony
    const data = { name: "John", age: 42 };

    class User extends React.Component {
      render() {
        return <pre>{JSON.stringify(data, null, 2)}</pre>;
      }
    }

    React.render(<User />, document.getElementById("container"));
    ```

      </p>
      </details>

67. ### Why can't you update props in React?

    The React philosophy is that props should be _immutable_(read only) and _top-down_. This means that a parent can send any prop values to a child, but the child can't modify received props.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

68. ### How to focus an input element on page load?

    You need to use `useEffect` hook to set focus on input field during page load time for functional component.

    ```jsx harmony
    import React, { useEffect, useRef } from "react";

    const App = () => {
      const inputElRef = useRef(null);

      useEffect(() => {
        inputElRef.current.focus();
      }, []);

      return (
        <div>
          <input defaultValue={"Won't focus"} />
          <input ref={inputElRef} defaultValue={"Will focus"} />
        </div>
      );
    };

    ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById("app"));
    ```

      <details><summary><b>See Class</b></summary>
      <p>
      You can do it by creating _ref_ for `input` element and using it in `componentDidMount()`:

    ```jsx harmony
    class App extends React.Component {
      componentDidMount() {
        this.nameInput.focus();
      }

      render() {
        return (
          <div>
            <input defaultValue={"Won't focus"} />
            <input
              ref={(input) => (this.nameInput = input)}
              defaultValue={"Will focus"}
            />
          </div>
        );
      }
    }

    ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById("app"));
    ```

69. ### How can we find the version of React at runtime in the browser?

    You can use `React.version` to get the version.

    ```jsx harmony
    const REACT_VERSION = React.version;

    ReactDOM.render(
      <div>{`React version: ${REACT_VERSION}`}</div>,
      document.getElementById("app")
    );

    Add a listener on the `history` object to record each page view:

    ```javascript
    history.listen(function (location) {
      window.ga("set", "page", location.pathname + location.search);
      window.ga("send", "pageview", location.pathname + location.search);
    });

71. ### How do you apply vendor prefixes to inline styles in React?

    React _does not_ apply _vendor prefixes_ automatically. You need to add vendor prefixes manually.

    ```jsx harmony
    <div
      style={{
        transform: "rotate(90deg)",
        WebkitTransform: "rotate(90deg)", // note the capital 'W' here
        msTransform: "rotate(90deg)", // 'ms' is the only lowercase vendor prefix
      }}
    />
    ```

72. ### How to import and export components using React and ES6?

    You should use default for exporting the components

    ```jsx harmony
    import User from "user";

    export default function MyProfile {
        return <User type="customer">//...</User>;
    }
    ```

    <details><summary><b>See Class</b></summary>
    <p>
     ```jsx harmony
     import React from "react";
     import User from "user";

    export default class MyProfile extends React.Component {
    render() {
    return <User type="customer">//...</User>;
    }
    }

    ```
    </p>
    </details>

    With the export specifier, the MyProfile is going to be the member and exported to this module and the same can be imported without mentioning the name in other components.
    ```

73. ### What are the exceptions on React component naming?

    The component names should start with an uppercase letter but there are few exceptions to this convention. The lowercase tag names with a dot (property accessors) are still considered as valid component names.
    For example, the below tag can be compiled to a valid component,

    ```jsx harmony
         render() {
              return (
                <obj.component/> // `React.createElement(obj.component)`
              )
        }
    ```

74. ### Is it possible to use async/await in plain React?

    Yes, you can use `async/await` in plain React, as long as your JavaScript environment supports ES2017+. Nowadays most modern browsers and build tools support ES2017+ version. If you're using **Create React App**, **Next.js**, **Remix**, or any modern React setup, `async/await` is supported out of the box through **Babel**.

    ### Example Usage

    ```jsx
    import { useEffect, useState } from 'react';

    function UserProfile() {
      const [user, setUser] = useState(null);

      useEffect(() => {
        const fetchUser = async () => {
          const response = await fetch('/api/user');
          const data = await response.json();
          setUser(data);
        };

        fetchUser();
      }, []);

      return user ? <div>Hello, {user.name}</div> : <div>Loading...</div>;
    }
    ```
    But If you're not using a bundler like **Webpack or Babel**, you will need _Babel_ and [transform-async-to-generator](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-transform-async-to-generator) plugin. However, React Native ships with Babel and a set of transforms.

75.  ### What are the common folder structures for React?

     There are two common practices for React project file structure.

     1.  **Grouping by features or routes:**

        One common way to structure projects is locate CSS, JS, and tests together, grouped by feature or route.

        ```
        common/
        ├─ Avatar.js
        ├─ Avatar.css
        ├─ APIUtils.js
        └─ APIUtils.test.js
        feed/
        ├─ index.js
        ├─ Feed.js
        ├─ Feed.css
        ├─ FeedStory.js
        ├─ FeedStory.test.js
        └─ FeedAPI.js
        profile/
        ├─ index.js
        ├─ Profile.js
        ├─ ProfileHeader.js
        ├─ ProfileHeader.css
        └─ ProfileAPI.js
        ```

     2.  **Grouping by file type:**

        Another popular way to structure projects is to group similar files together.

        ```
        api/
        ├─ APIUtils.js
        ├─ APIUtils.test.js
        ├─ ProfileAPI.js
        └─ UserAPI.js
        components/
        ├─ Avatar.js
        ├─ Avatar.css
        ├─ Feed.js
        ├─ Feed.css
        ├─ FeedStory.js
        ├─ FeedStory.test.js
        ├─ Profile.js
        ├─ ProfileHeader.js
        └─ ProfileHeader.css
        ```

77. ### What is the benefit of styles modules?

    It is recommended to avoid hard coding style values in components. Any values that are likely to be used across different UI components should be extracted into their own modules.

    For example, these styles could be extracted into a separate component:

    ```javascript
    export const colors = {
      white,
      black,
      blue,
    };

    export const space = [0, 8, 16, 32, 64];
    ```

    And then imported individually in other components:

    ```javascript
    import { space, colors } from "./styles";
    ```

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

78. ### What are the popular React-specific linters?

    ESLint is a popular JavaScript linter. There are plugins available that analyse specific code styles. One of the most common for React is an npm package called `eslint-plugin-react`. By default, it will check a number of best practices, with rules checking things from keys in iterators to a complete set of prop types.

    Another popular plugin is `eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y`, which will help fix common issues with accessibility. As JSX offers slightly different syntax to regular HTML, issues with `alt` text and `tabindex`, for example, will not be picked up by regular plugins.

## React Router

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

79. ### What is React Router?

    React Router is a powerful routing library built on top of React that helps you add new screens and flows to your application incredibly quickly, all while keeping the URL in sync with what's being displayed on the page.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

80. ### How React Router is different from history library?

    React Router is a wrapper around the `history` library which handles interaction with the browser's `window.history` with its browser and hash histories. It also provides memory history which is useful for environments that don't have global history, such as mobile app development (React Native) and unit testing with Node.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

81. ### What are the `<Router>` components of React Router v6?

    React Router v6 provides below 4 `<Router>` components:

    1.  `<BrowserRouter>`:Uses the HTML5 history API for standard web apps.
    2.  `<HashRouter>`:Uses hash-based routing for static servers.
    3.  `<MemoryRouter>`:Uses in-memory routing for testing and non-browser environments.
    4.  `<StaticRouter>`:Provides static routing for server-side rendering (SSR).

    The above components will create _browser_, _hash_, _memory_ and _static_ history instances. React Router v6 makes the properties and methods of the `history` instance associated with your router available through the context in the `router` object.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

82. ### What is the purpose of `push()` and `replace()` methods of `history`?

    A history instance has two methods for navigation purpose.

    1.  `push()`
    2.  `replace()`

    If you think of the history as an array of visited locations, `push()` will add a new location to the array and `replace()` will replace the current location in the array with the new one.

83. ### How do you programmatically navigate using React Router v4?

    There are three different ways to achieve programmatic routing/navigation within components.

    1.  **Using the `withRouter()` higher-order function:**

        The `withRouter()` higher-order function will inject the history object as a prop of the component. This object provides `push()` and `replace()` methods to avoid the usage of context.

        ```jsx harmony
        import { withRouter } from "react-router-dom"; // this also works with 'react-router-native'

        const Button = withRouter(({ history }) => (
          <button
            type="button"
            onClick={() => {
              history.push("/new-location");
            }}
          >
            {"Click Me!"}
          </button>
        ));
        ```

    2.  **Using `<Route>` component and render props pattern:**

        The `<Route>` component passes the same props as `withRouter()`, so you will be able to access the history methods through the history prop.

        ```jsx harmony
        import { Route } from "react-router-dom";

        const Button = () => (
          <Route
            render={({ history }) => (
              <button
                type="button"
                onClick={() => {
                  history.push("/new-location");
                }}
              >
                {"Click Me!"}
              </button>
            )}
          />
        );
        ```

    3.  **Using context:**

        This option is not recommended and treated as unstable API.

        ```jsx harmony
        const Button = (props, context) => (
          <button
            type="button"
            onClick={() => {
              context.history.push("/new-location");
            }}
          >
            {"Click Me!"}
          </button>
        );

        Button.contextTypes = {
          history: React.PropTypes.shape({
            push: React.PropTypes.func.isRequired,
          }),
        };
        ```

84. ### How to get query parameters in React Router v4?

    The ability to parse query strings was taken out of React Router v4 because there have been user requests over the years to support different implementation. So the decision has been given to users to choose the implementation they like. The recommended approach is to use query strings library.

    ```javascript
    const queryString = require("query-string");
    const parsed = queryString.parse(props.location.search);
    ```

    You can also use `URLSearchParams` if you want something native:

    ```javascript
    const params = new URLSearchParams(props.location.search);
    const foo = params.get("name");
    ```

    You should use a _polyfill_ for IE11.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

85. ### Why you get "Router may have only one child element" warning?

    You have to wrap your Route's in a `<Switch>` block because `<Switch>` is unique in that it renders a route exclusively.

    At first you need to add `Switch` to your imports:

    ```javascript
    import { Switch, Router, Route } from "react-router";
    ```

    Then define the routes within `<Switch>` block:

    ```jsx harmony
    <Router>
      <Switch>
        <Route {/* ... */} />
        <Route {/* ... */} />
      </Switch>
    </Router>
    ```

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

86. ### How to pass params to `history.push` method in React Router v4?

    While navigating you can pass props to the `history` object:

    ```javascript
    this.props.history.push({
      pathname: "/template",
      search: "?name=sudheer",
      state: { detail: response.data },
    });
    ```

    The `search` property is used to pass query params in `push()` method.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

87. ### How to implement _default_ or _NotFound_ page?

    A `<Switch>` renders the first child `<Route>` that matches. A `<Route>` with no path always matches. So you just need to simply drop path attribute as below

    ```jsx harmony
    <Switch>
      <Route exact path="/" component={Home} />
      <Route path="/user" component={User} />
      <Route component={NotFound} />
    </Switch>
    ```

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

88. ### How to get history on React Router v4?

    Below are the list of steps to get history object on React Router v4,

    1.  Create a module that exports a `history` object and import this module across the project.

        For example, create `history.js` file:

        ```javascript
        import { createBrowserHistory } from "history";

        export default createBrowserHistory({
          /* pass a configuration object here if needed */
        });
        ```

    2.  You should use the `<Router>` component instead of built-in routers. Import the above `history.js` inside `index.js` file:

        ```jsx harmony
        import { Router } from "react-router-dom";
        import history from "./history";
        import App from "./App";

        ReactDOM.render(
          <Router history={history}>
            <App />
          </Router>,
          holder
        );
        ```

    3.  You can also use push method of `history` object similar to built-in history object:

        ```javascript
        // some-other-file.js
        import history from "./history";

        history.push("/go-here");
        ```

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

89. ### How to perform automatic redirect after login?

    The `react-router` package provides `<Redirect>` component in React Router. Rendering a `<Redirect>` will navigate to a new location. Like server-side redirects, the new location will override the current location in the history stack.

    ```javascript
    import { Redirect } from "react-router";

    export default function Login {
        if (this.state.isLoggedIn === true) {
          return <Redirect to="/your/redirect/page" />;
        } else {
          return <div>{"Login Please"}</div>;
        }
    }
    ```

      <details><summary><b>See Class</b></summary>
      <p>

    ```jsx
    import React, { Component } from "react";
    import { Redirect } from "react-router";

    export default class LoginComponent extends Component {
      render() {
        if (this.state.isLoggedIn === true) {
          return <Redirect to="/your/redirect/page" />;
        } else {
          return <div>{"Login Please"}</div>;
        }
      }
    }
    ```

       </p>
       </details>

## React Internationalization

90. ### What is React Intl?

    The _React Intl_ library makes internationalization in React straightforward, with off-the-shelf components and an API that can handle everything from formatting strings, dates, and numbers, to pluralization. React Intl is part of _FormatJS_ which provides bindings to React via its components and API.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

91. ### What are the main features of React Intl?

    Below are the main features of React Intl,

    1.  Display numbers with separators.
    2.  Display dates and times correctly.
    3.  Display dates relative to "now".
    4.  Pluralize labels in strings.
    5.  Support for 150+ languages.
    6.  Runs in the browser and Node.
    7.  Built on standards.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

92. ### What are the two ways of formatting in React Intl?

    The library provides two ways to format strings, numbers, and dates:

    1.  **Using react components:**

        ```jsx harmony
        <FormattedMessage
          id={"account"}
          defaultMessage={"The amount is less than minimum balance."}
        />
        ```

    2.  **Using an API:**

        ```javascript
        const messages = defineMessages({
          accountMessage: {
            id: "account",
            defaultMessage: "The amount is less than minimum balance.",
          },
        });

        formatMessage(messages.accountMessage);
        ```

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

93. ### How to use `<FormattedMessage>` as placeholder using React Intl?

    The `<Formatted... />` components from `react-intl` return elements, not plain text, so they can't be used for placeholders, alt text, etc. In that case, you should use lower level API `formatMessage()`. You can inject the `intl` object into your component using `injectIntl()` higher-order component and then format the message using `formatMessage()` available on that object.

    ```jsx harmony
    import React from "react";
    import { injectIntl, intlShape } from "react-intl";

    const MyComponent = ({ intl }) => {
      const placeholder = intl.formatMessage({ id: "messageId" });
      return <input placeholder={placeholder} />;
    };

    MyComponent.propTypes = {
      intl: intlShape.isRequired,
    };

    export default injectIntl(MyComponent);
    ```

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

94. ### How to access current locale with React Intl?

    You can get the current locale in any component of your application using `injectIntl()`:

    ```jsx harmony
    import { injectIntl, intlShape } from "react-intl";

    const MyComponent = ({ intl }) => (
      <div>{`The current locale is ${intl.locale}`}</div>
    );

    MyComponent.propTypes = {
      intl: intlShape.isRequired,
    };

    export default injectIntl(MyComponent);
    ```

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

95. ### How to format date using React Intl?

     The `injectIntl()` higher-order component will give you access to the `formatDate()` method via the props in your component. The method is used internally by instances of `FormattedDate` and it returns the string representation of the formatted date.

     ```jsx harmony
     import { injectIntl, intlShape } from "react-intl";

     const stringDate = this.props.intl.formatDate(date, {
       year: "numeric",
       month: "numeric",
       day: "numeric",
     });

     const MyComponent = ({ intl }) => (
       <div>{`The formatted date is ${stringDate}`}</div>
     );

     MyComponent.propTypes = {
       intl: intlShape.isRequired,
     };

     export default injectIntl(MyComponent);
     ```

## React Testing

96. ### What is Shallow Renderer in React testing?

    _Shallow rendering_ is useful for writing unit test cases in React. It lets you render a component _one level deep_ and assert facts about what its render method returns, without worrying about the behavior of child components, which are not instantiated or rendered.

    For example, if you have the following component:

    ```javascript
    function MyComponent() {
      return (
        <div>
          <span className={"heading"}>{"Title"}</span>
          <span className={"description"}>{"Description"}</span>
        </div>
      );
    }
    ```

    Then you can assert as follows:

    ```jsx harmony
    import ShallowRenderer from "react-test-renderer/shallow";

    // in your test
    const renderer = new ShallowRenderer();
    renderer.render(<MyComponent />);

    const result = renderer.getRenderOutput();

    expect(result.type).toBe("div");
    expect(result.props.children).toEqual([
      <span className={"heading"}>{"Title"}</span>,
      <span className={"description"}>{"Description"}</span>,
    ]);
    ```

97. ### What is `TestRenderer` package in React?

    This package provides a renderer that can be used to render components to pure JavaScript objects, without depending on the DOM or a native mobile environment. This package makes it easy to grab a snapshot of the platform view hierarchy (similar to a DOM tree) rendered by a ReactDOM or React Native without using a browser or `jsdom`.

    ```jsx harmony
    import TestRenderer from "react-test-renderer";

    const Link = ({ page, children }) => <a href={page}>{children}</a>;

    const testRenderer = TestRenderer.create(
      <Link page={"https://www.facebook.com/"}>{"Facebook"}</Link>
    );

    console.log(testRenderer.toJSON());
    // {
    //   type: 'a',
    //   props: { href: 'https://www.facebook.com/' },
    //   children: [ 'Facebook' ]
    // }
    ```

98. ### What is the purpose of ReactTestUtils package?

    _ReactTestUtils_ are provided in the `with-addons` package and allow you to perform actions against a simulated DOM for the purpose of unit testing.

99. ### What is Jest?

    _Jest_ is a JavaScript unit testing framework created by Facebook based on Jasmine and provides automated mock creation and a `jsdom` environment. It's often used for testing components.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

100. ### What are the advantages of Jest over Jasmine?

     There are couple of advantages compared to Jasmine:

     - Automatically finds tests to execute in your source code.
     - Automatically mocks dependencies when running your tests.
     - Allows you to test asynchronous code synchronously.
     - Runs your tests with a fake DOM implementation (via `jsdom`) so that your tests can be run on the command line.
     - Runs tests in parallel processes so that they finish sooner.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

101. ### Give a simple example of Jest test case

     Let's write a test for a function that adds two numbers in `sum.js` file:

     ```javascript
     const sum = (a, b) => a + b;

     export default sum;
     ```

     Create a file named `sum.test.js` which contains actual test:

     ```javascript
     import sum from "./sum";

     test("adds 1 + 2 to equal 3", () => {
       expect(sum(1, 2)).toBe(3);
     });
     ```

     And then add the following section to your `package.json`:

     ```json
     {
       "scripts": {
         "test": "jest"
       }
     }
     ```

     Finally, run `yarn test` or `npm test` and Jest will print a result:

     ```console
     $ yarn test
     PASS ./sum.test.js
     ✓ adds 1 + 2 to equal 3 (2ms)
     ```

## React Redux

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

102. ### What is flux?

       **Flux** is an **application architecture** (not a framework or library) designed by Facebook to manage **data flow** in React applications. It was created as an alternative to the traditional **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** pattern, and it emphasizes a **unidirectional data flow** to make state changes more predictable and easier to debug.

       Flux complements React by organizing the way data moves through your application, especially in large-scale or complex projects.

       #### Core Concepts of Flux

       Flux operates using **four key components**, each with a specific responsibility:
       *   **Actions**
             *   Plain JavaScript objects or functions that describe _what happened_ (e.g., user interactions or API responses).
             *   Example: `{ type: 'ADD_TODO', payload: 'Buy milk' }`
       *   **Dispatcher**
             *   A central hub that receives actions and **dispatches** them to the appropriate stores.
             *   There is **only one dispatcher** in a Flux application.
       *   **Stores**
             *   Hold the **application state** and business logic.
             *   Respond to actions from the dispatcher and update themselves accordingly.
             *   They **emit change events** that views can listen to.
       *   **Views (React Components)**
             *   Subscribe to stores and **re-render** when the data changes.
             *   They can also trigger new actions (e.g., on user input).


       The workflow between dispatcher, stores and views components with distinct inputs and outputs as follows:

       ![flux](images/flux.png)

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

103.  ### What is Redux?
       Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript applications, most commonly used with React. It helps you manage and centralize your application’s state in a single source of truth, enabling easier debugging, testing, and maintenance—especially in large or complex applications. Redux core is tiny library(about 2.5kB gzipped) and has no dependencies.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

104. ### What are the core principles of Redux?

     Redux follows three fundamental principles:

     1. **Single source of truth:** The state of your whole application is stored in an object tree within a single store. The single state tree makes it easier to keep track of changes over time and debug or inspect the application.
   
      ```jsx
      const store = createStore(reducer);
      ```
     2. **State is read-only:** The only way to change the state is to emit an action, an object describing what happened. This ensures that neither the views nor the network callbacks will ever write directly to the state.
      ```js
      const action = { type: 'INCREMENT' };
      store.dispatch(action);
      ```
     3. **Changes are made with pure functions(Reducers):** To specify how the state tree is transformed by actions, you write reducers. Reducers are just pure functions that take the previous state and an action as parameters, and return the next state.
      
      ```jsx
      function counter(state = 0, action) {
        switch (action.type) {
          case 'INCREMENT':
            return state + 1;
          case 'DECREMENT':
            return state - 1;
          default:
            return state;
        }
      }
      ```

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

105. ### What are the downsides of Redux compared to Flux?

     While Redux offers a powerful and predictable state management solution, it comes with a few trade-offs when compared to Flux. These include:

     1.  **Immutability is essential**  
        Redux enforces a strict immutability model for state updates, which differs from Flux’s more relaxed approach. This means you must avoid mutating state directly. Many Redux-related libraries assume immutability, so your team must be disciplined in writing pure update logic. You can use tools like `redux-immutable-state-invariant`, `Immer`, or `Immutable.js` to help enforce this practice, especially during development.
     2.  **Careful selection of complementary packages**  
        Redux is more minimal by design and provides extension points such as middleware and store enhancers. This has led to a large ecosystem, but it also means you must thoughtfully choose and configure additional packages for features like undo/redo, persistence, or form handling—something Flux explicitly leaves out but may be simpler to manage in smaller setups.
     3.  **Limited static type integration**  
        While Flux has mature support for static type checking with tools like Flow, Redux’s type integration is less seamless. Although TypeScript is commonly used with Redux now, early Flow support was limited, and more boilerplate was required for static type safety. This may affect teams that rely heavily on type systems for large codebases.


**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

106. ### What is the difference between `mapStateToProps()` and `mapDispatchToProps()`?

     `mapStateToProps()` is a utility which helps your component get updated state (which is updated by some other components):

     ```javascript
     const mapStateToProps = (state) => {
       return {
         todos: getVisibleTodos(state.todos, state.visibilityFilter),
       };
     };
     ```

     `mapDispatchToProps()` is a utility which will help your component to fire an action event (dispatching action which may cause change of application state):

     ```javascript
     const mapDispatchToProps = (dispatch) => {
       return {
         onTodoClick: (id) => {
           dispatch(toggleTodo(id));
         },
       };
     };
     ```

     It is recommended to always use the “object shorthand” form for the `mapDispatchToProps`.

     Redux wraps it in another function that looks like (…args) => dispatch(onTodoClick(…args)), and pass that wrapper function as a prop to your component.

     ```javascript
     const mapDispatchToProps = {
       onTodoClick,
     };
     ```

107. ### Can I dispatch an action in reducer?

     Dispatching an action within a reducer is an **anti-pattern**. Your reducer should be _without side effects_, simply digesting the action payload and returning a new state object. Adding listeners and dispatching actions within the reducer can lead to chained actions and other side effects.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

108. ### How to access Redux store outside a component?

     You just need to export the store from the module where it created with `createStore()`. Also, it shouldn't pollute the global window object.

     ```javascript
     store = createStore(myReducer);

     export default store;
     ```

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

109. ### What are the drawbacks of MVW pattern?

     1. DOM manipulation is very expensive which causes applications to behave slow and inefficient.
     2. Due to circular dependencies, a complicated model was created around models and views.
     3. Lot of data changes happens for collaborative applications(like Google Docs).
     4. No way to do undo (travel back in time) easily without adding so much extra code.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

110. ### Are there any similarities between Redux and RxJS?

     These libraries are very different for very different purposes, but there are some vague similarities.

     Redux is a tool for managing state throughout the application. It is usually used as an architecture for UIs. Think of it as an alternative to (half of) Angular. RxJS is a reactive programming library. It is usually used as a tool to accomplish asynchronous tasks in JavaScript. Think of it as an alternative to Promises. Redux uses the Reactive paradigm because the Store is reactive. The Store observes actions from a distance, and changes itself. RxJS also uses the Reactive paradigm, but instead of being an architecture, it gives you basic building blocks, Observables, to accomplish this pattern.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

111. ### How to reset state in Redux?

     You need to write a _root reducer_ in your application which delegate handling the action to the reducer generated by `combineReducers()`.

     For example, let us take `rootReducer()` to return the initial state after `USER_LOGOUT` action. As we know, reducers are supposed to return the initial state when they are called with `undefined` as the first argument, no matter the action.

     ```javascript
     const appReducer = combineReducers({
       /* your app's top-level reducers */
     });

     const rootReducer = (state, action) => {
       if (action.type === "USER_LOGOUT") {
         state = undefined;
       }

       return appReducer(state, action);
     };
     ```

     In case of using `redux-persist`, you may also need to clean your storage. `redux-persist` keeps a copy of your state in a storage engine. First, you need to import the appropriate storage engine and then, to parse the state before setting it to undefined and clean each storage state key.

     ```javascript
     const appReducer = combineReducers({
       /* your app's top-level reducers */
     });

     const rootReducer = (state, action) => {
       if (action.type === "USER_LOGOUT") {
         Object.keys(state).forEach((key) => {
           storage.removeItem(`persist:${key}`);
         });

         state = undefined;
       }

       return appReducer(state, action);
     };
     ```

112. ### What is the difference between React context and React Redux?

     You can use **Context** in your application directly and is going to be great for passing down data to deeply nested components which what it was designed for.

     Whereas **Redux** is much more powerful and provides a large number of features that the Context API doesn't provide. Also, React Redux uses context internally but it doesn't expose this fact in the public API.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

113. ### Why are Redux state functions called reducers?

     Reducers always return the accumulation of the state (based on all previous and current actions). Therefore, they act as a reducer of state. Each time a Redux reducer is called, the state and action are passed as parameters. This state is then reduced (or accumulated) based on the action, and then the next state is returned. You could _reduce_ a collection of actions and an initial state (of the store) on which to perform these actions to get the resulting final state.

114. ### How to make AJAX request in Redux?

     You can use `redux-thunk` middleware which allows you to define async actions.

     Let's take an example of fetching specific account as an AJAX call using _fetch API_:

     ```javascript
     export function fetchAccount(id) {
       return (dispatch) => {
         dispatch(setLoadingAccountState()); // Show a loading spinner
         fetch(`/account/${id}`, (response) => {
           dispatch(doneFetchingAccount()); // Hide loading spinner
           if (response.status === 200) {
             dispatch(setAccount(response.json)); // Use a normal function to set the received state
           } else {
             dispatch(someError);
           }
         });
       };
     }

     function setAccount(data) {
       return { type: "SET_Account", data: data };
     }
     ```

115. ### Should I keep all component's state in Redux store?

     Keep your data in the Redux store, and the UI related state internally in the component.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

116. ### What is the proper way to access Redux store?

     The best way to access your store in a component is to use the `connect()` function, that creates a new component that wraps around your existing one. This pattern is called _Higher-Order Components_, and is generally the preferred way of extending a component's functionality in React. This allows you to map state and action creators to your component, and have them passed in automatically as your store updates.

     Let's take an example of `<FilterLink>` component using connect:

     ```javascript
     import { connect } from "react-redux";
     import { setVisibilityFilter } from "../actions";
     import Link from "../components/Link";

     const mapStateToProps = (state, ownProps) => ({
       active: ownProps.filter === state.visibilityFilter,
     });

     const mapDispatchToProps = (dispatch, ownProps) => ({
       onClick: () => dispatch(setVisibilityFilter(ownProps.filter)),
     });

     const FilterLink = connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps)(Link);

     export default FilterLink;
     ```

     Due to it having quite a few performance optimizations and generally being less likely to cause bugs, the Redux developers almost always recommend using `connect()` over accessing the store directly (using context API).

     ```javascript
     function MyComponent {
       someMethod() {
         doSomethingWith(this.context.store);
       }
     }
     ```

117. ### What is the difference between component and container in React Redux?

     **Component** is a class or function component that describes the presentational part of your application.

     **Container** is an informal term for a component that is connected to a Redux store. Containers _subscribe_ to Redux state updates and _dispatch_ actions, and they usually don't render DOM elements; they delegate rendering to presentational child components.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

118. ### What is the purpose of the constants in Redux?

     Constants allows you to easily find all usages of that specific functionality across the project when you use an IDE. It also prevents you from introducing silly bugs caused by typos – in which case, you will get a `ReferenceError` immediately.

     Normally we will save them in a single file (`constants.js` or `actionTypes.js`).

     ```javascript
     export const ADD_TODO = "ADD_TODO";
     export const DELETE_TODO = "DELETE_TODO";
     export const EDIT_TODO = "EDIT_TODO";
     export const COMPLETE_TODO = "COMPLETE_TODO";
     export const COMPLETE_ALL = "COMPLETE_ALL";
     export const CLEAR_COMPLETED = "CLEAR_COMPLETED";
     ```

     In Redux, you use them in two places:

     1. **During action creation:**

        Let's take `actions.js`:

        ```javascript
        import { ADD_TODO } from "./actionTypes";

        export function addTodo(text) {
          return { type: ADD_TODO, text };
        }
        ```

     2. **In reducers:**

        Let's create `reducer.js`:

        ```javascript
        import { ADD_TODO } from "./actionTypes";

        export default (state = [], action) => {
          switch (action.type) {
            case ADD_TODO:
              return [
                ...state,
                {
                  text: action.text,
                  completed: false,
                },
              ];
            default:
              return state;
          }
        };
        ```

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

119. ### What are the different ways to write `mapDispatchToProps()`?

     There are a few ways of binding _action creators_ to `dispatch()` in `mapDispatchToProps()`.

     Below are the possible options:

     ```javascript
     const mapDispatchToProps = (dispatch) => ({
       action: () => dispatch(action()),
     });
     ```

     ```javascript
     const mapDispatchToProps = (dispatch) => ({
       action: bindActionCreators(action, dispatch),
     });
     ```

     ```javascript
     const mapDispatchToProps = { action };
     ```

     The third option is just a shorthand for the first one.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

120. ### What is the use of the `ownProps` parameter in `mapStateToProps()` and `mapDispatchToProps()`?

     If the `ownProps` parameter is specified, React Redux will pass the props that were passed to the component into your _connect_ functions. So, if you use a connected component:

     ```jsx harmony
     import ConnectedComponent from "./containers/ConnectedComponent";

     <ConnectedComponent user={"john"} />;
     ```

     The `ownProps` inside your `mapStateToProps()` and `mapDispatchToProps()` functions will be an object:

     ```javascript
     {
       user: "john";
     }
     ```

     You can use this object to decide what to return from those functions.

121. ### How to structure Redux top level directories?

     Most of the applications has several top-level directories as below:

     1. **Components**: Used for _dumb_ components unaware of Redux.
     2. **Containers**: Used for _smart_ components connected to Redux.
     3. **Actions**: Used for all action creators, where file names correspond to part of the app.
     4. **Reducers**: Used for all reducers, where files name correspond to state key.
     5. **Store**: Used for store initialization.

     This structure works well for small and medium size apps.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

122. ### What is redux-saga?

     `redux-saga` is a library that aims to make side effects (asynchronous things like data fetching and impure things like accessing the browser cache) in React/Redux applications easier and better.

     It is available in NPM:

     ```console
     $ npm install --save redux-saga
     ```

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

123. ### What is the mental model of redux-saga?

     _Saga_ is like a separate thread in your application, that's solely responsible for side effects. `redux-saga` is a redux _middleware_, which means this thread can be started, paused and cancelled from the main application with normal Redux actions, it has access to the full Redux application state and it can dispatch Redux actions as well.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

124. ### What are the differences between `call()` and `put()` in redux-saga?

     Both `call()` and `put()` are effect creator functions. `call()` function is used to create effect description, which instructs middleware to call the promise. `put()` function creates an effect, which instructs middleware to dispatch an action to the store.

     Let's take example of how these effects work for fetching particular user data.

     ```javascript
     function* fetchUserSaga(action) {
       // `call` function accepts rest arguments, which will be passed to `api.fetchUser` function.
       // Instructing middleware to call promise, it resolved value will be assigned to `userData` variable
       const userData = yield call(api.fetchUser, action.userId);

       // Instructing middleware to dispatch corresponding action.
       yield put({
         type: "FETCH_USER_SUCCESS",
         userData,
       });
     }
     ```

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

125. ### What is Redux Thunk?

     _Redux Thunk_ middleware allows you to write action creators that return a function instead of an action. The thunk can be used to delay the dispatch of an action, or to dispatch only if a certain condition is met. The inner function receives the store methods `dispatch()` and `getState()` as parameters.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

126. ### What are the differences between `redux-saga` and `redux-thunk`?

     Both _Redux Thunk_ and _Redux Saga_ take care of dealing with side effects. In most of the scenarios, Thunk uses _Promises_ to deal with them, whereas Saga uses _Generators_. Thunk is simple to use and Promises are familiar to many developers, Sagas/Generators are more powerful but you will need to learn them. But both middleware can coexist, so you can start with Thunks and introduce Sagas when/if you need them.

127. ### What is Redux DevTools?

     _Redux DevTools_ is a live-editing time travel environment for Redux with hot reloading, action replay, and customizable UI. If you don't want to bother with installing Redux DevTools and integrating it into your project, consider using Redux DevTools Extension for Chrome and Firefox.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

128. ### What are the features of Redux DevTools?

     Some of the main features of Redux DevTools are below,

     1. Lets you inspect every state and action payload.
     2. Lets you go back in time by _cancelling_ actions.
     3. If you change the reducer code, each _staged_ action will be re-evaluated.
     4. If the reducers throw, you will see during which action this happened, and what the error was.
     5. With `persistState()` store enhancer, you can persist debug sessions across page reloads.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

129. ### What are Redux selectors and why use them?

     _Selectors_ are functions that take Redux state as an argument and return some data to pass to the component.

     For example, to get user details from the state:

     ```javascript
     const getUserData = (state) => state.user.data;
     ```

     These selectors have two main benefits,

     1. The selector can compute derived data, allowing Redux to store the minimal possible state
     2. The selector is not recomputed unless one of its arguments changes

130. ### What is Redux Form?

     _Redux Form_ works with React and Redux to enable a form in React to use Redux to store all of its state. Redux Form can be used with raw HTML5 inputs, but it also works very well with common UI frameworks like Material UI, React Widgets and React Bootstrap.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

131. ### What are the main features of Redux Form?

     Some of the main features of Redux Form are:

     1. Field values persistence via Redux store.
     2. Validation (sync/async) and submission.
     3. Formatting, parsing and normalization of field values.

132. ### How to add multiple middlewares to Redux?

     You can use `applyMiddleware()`.

     For example, you can add `redux-thunk` and `logger` passing them as arguments to `applyMiddleware()`:

     ```javascript
     import { createStore, applyMiddleware } from "redux";
     const createStoreWithMiddleware = applyMiddleware(
       ReduxThunk,
       logger
     )(createStore);
     ```

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

133. ### How to set initial state in Redux?

     You need to pass initial state as second argument to createStore:

     ```javascript
     const rootReducer = combineReducers({
       todos: todos,
       visibilityFilter: visibilityFilter,
     });

     const initialState = {
       todos: [{ id: 123, name: "example", completed: false }],
     };

     const store = createStore(rootReducer, initialState);
     ```

134. ### How Relay is different from Redux?

     Relay is similar to Redux in that they both use a single store. The main difference is that relay only manages state originated from the server, and all access to the state is used via _GraphQL_ queries (for reading data) and mutations (for changing data). Relay caches the data for you and optimizes data fetching for you, by fetching only changed data and nothing more.

135. ### What is an action in Redux?

     _Actions_ are plain JavaScript objects or payloads of information that send data from your application to your store. They are the only source of information for the store. Actions must have a type property that indicates the type of action being performed.

     For example, let's take an action which represents adding a new todo item:

     ```
     {
       type: ADD_TODO,
       text: 'Add todo item'
     }
     ```

## React Native

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

136. ### What is the difference between React Native and React?

     **React** is a JavaScript library, supporting both front end web and being run on the server, for building user interfaces and web applications.

     **React Native** is a mobile framework that compiles to native app components, allowing you to build native mobile applications (iOS, Android, and Windows) in JavaScript that allows you to use React to build your components, and implements React under the hood.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

137. ### How to test React Native apps?

     React Native can be tested only in mobile simulators like iOS and Android. You can run the app in your mobile using expo app (https://expo.io) Where it syncs using QR code, your mobile and computer should be in same wireless network.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

138. ### How to do logging in React Native?

     You can use `console.log`, `console.warn`, etc. As of React Native v0.29 you can simply run the following to see logs in the console:

     ```
     $ react-native log-ios
     $ react-native log-android
     ```

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

139. ### How to debug your React Native?

     Follow the below steps to debug React Native app:

     1. Run your application in the iOS simulator.
     2. Press `Command + D` and a webpage should open up at `http://localhost:8081/debugger-ui`.
     3. Enable _Pause On Caught Exceptions_ for a better debugging experience.
     4. Press `Command + Option + I` to open the Chrome Developer tools, or open it via `View` -> `Developer` -> `Developer Tools`.
     5. You should now be able to debug as you normally would.

140. ### What is reselect and how it works?

     _Reselect_ is a **selector library** (for Redux) which uses _memoization_ concept. It was originally written to compute derived data from Redux-like applications state, but it can't be tied to any architecture or library.

     Reselect keeps a copy of the last inputs/outputs of the last call, and recomputes the result only if one of the inputs changes. If the same inputs are provided twice in a row, Reselect returns the cached output. It's memoization and cache are fully customizable.

141. ### What is Flow?

     _Flow_ is a _static type checker_ designed to find type errors in JavaScript. Flow types can express much more fine-grained distinctions than traditional type systems. For example, Flow helps you catch errors involving `null`, unlike most type systems.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

142. ### What is the difference between Flow and PropTypes?

     Flow is a _static analysis tool_ (static checker) which uses a superset of the language, allowing you to add type annotations to all of your code and catch an entire class of bugs at compile time.

     PropTypes is a _basic type checker_ (runtime checker) which has been patched onto React. It can't check anything other than the types of the props being passed to a given component. If you want more flexible typechecking for your entire project Flow/TypeScript are appropriate choices.

143. ### How to use Font Awesome icons in React?

     The below steps followed to include Font Awesome in React:

     1. Install `font-awesome`:

        ```console
        $ npm install --save font-awesome
        ```

     2. Import `font-awesome` in your `index.js` file:

        ```javascript
        import "font-awesome/css/font-awesome.min.css";
        ```

     3. Add Font Awesome classes in `className`:

        ```javascript
        function MyComponent {
          return <div><i className={'fa fa-spinner'} /></div>
        }
        ```

144. ### What is React Dev Tools?

     _React Developer Tools_ let you inspect the component hierarchy, including component props and state. It exists both as a browser extension (for Chrome and Firefox), and as a standalone app (works with other environments including Safari, IE, and React Native).

     The official extensions available for different browsers or environments.

     1. **Chrome extension**
     2. **Firefox extension**
     3. **Standalone app** (Safari, React Native, etc)

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

145. ### Why is DevTools not loading in Chrome for local files?

     If you opened a local HTML file in your browser (`file://...`) then you must first open _Chrome Extensions_ and check `Allow access to file URLs`.

146. ### How to use Polymer in React?

     You need to follow below steps to use Polymer in React,

     1. Create a Polymer element:

        ```jsx harmony
        <link
          rel="import"
          href="../../bower_components/polymer/polymer.html"
        />;
        Polymer({
          is: "calendar-element",
          ready: function () {
            this.textContent = "I am a calendar";
          },
        });
        ```

     2. Create the Polymer component HTML tag by importing it in a HTML document, e.g. import it in the `index.html` of your React application:

        ```html
        <link
          rel="import"
          href="./src/polymer-components/calendar-element.html"
        />
        ```

     3. Use that element in the JSX file:

        ```javascript
        export default function MyComponent {
          return <calendar-element />;
        }
        ```

     React has the following advantages over Vue.js:

     1. Gives more flexibility in large apps developing.
     2. Easier to test.
     3. Suitable for mobile apps creating.
     4. More information and solutions available.

148. ### What is the difference between React and Angular?

     Let's see the difference between React and Angular in a table format.

     | React                                                                                       | Angular                                                                                                                            |
     | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
     | React is a library and has only the View layer                                              | Angular is a framework and has complete MVC functionality                                                                          |
     | React handles rendering on the server side                                                  | AngularJS renders only on the client side but Angular 2 and above renders on the server side                                       |
     | React uses JSX that looks like HTML in JS which can be confusing                            | Angular follows the template approach for HTML, which makes code shorter and easy to understand                                    |
     | React Native, which is a React type to build mobile applications are faster and more stable | Ionic, Angular's mobile native app is relatively less stable and slower                                                            |
     | In React, data flows only in one way and hence debugging is easy                            | In Angular, data flows both way i.e it has two-way data binding between children and parent and hence debugging is often difficult |

**Note:** The above list of differences are purely opinionated and it vary based on the professional experience. But they are helpful as base parameters.

149. ### Why React tab is not showing up in DevTools?

     When the page loads, _React DevTools_ sets a global named `__REACT_DEVTOOLS_GLOBAL_HOOK__`, then React communicates with that hook during initialization. If the website is not using React or if React fails to communicate with DevTools then it won't show up the tab.

150. ### What are Styled Components?

     `styled-components` is a JavaScript library for styling React applications. It removes the mapping between styles and components, and lets you write actual CSS augmented with JavaScript.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

151. ### Give an example of Styled Components?

     Lets create `<Title>` and `<Wrapper>` components with specific styles for each.

     ```javascript
     import React from "react";
     import styled from "styled-components";

     // Create a <Title> component that renders an <h1> which is centered, red and sized at 1.5em
     const Title = styled.h1`
       font-size: 1.5em;
       text-align: center;
       color: palevioletred;
     `;

     // Create a <Wrapper> component that renders a <section> with some padding and a papayawhip background
     const Wrapper = styled.section`
       padding: 4em;
       background: papayawhip;
     `;
     ```

     These two variables, `Title` and `Wrapper`, are now components that you can render just like any other react component.

     ```jsx harmony
     <Wrapper>
       <Title>{"Lets start first styled component!"}</Title>
     </Wrapper>
     ```

## Miscellaneous

153. ### What are the main features of Reselect library?

     Let's see the main features of Reselect library,

     1. Selectors can compute derived data, allowing Redux to store the minimal possible state.
     2. Selectors are efficient. A selector is not recomputed unless one of its arguments changes.
     3. Selectors are composable. They can be used as input to other selectors.

154. #### Give an example of Reselect usage?

     Let's take calculations and different amounts of a shipment order with the simplified usage of Reselect:

     ```javascript
     import { createSelector } from "reselect";

     const shopItemsSelector = (state) => state.shop.items;
     const taxPercentSelector = (state) => state.shop.taxPercent;

     const subtotalSelector = createSelector(shopItemsSelector, (items) =>
       items.reduce((acc, item) => acc + item.value, 0)
     );

     const taxSelector = createSelector(
       subtotalSelector,
       taxPercentSelector,
       (subtotal, taxPercent) => subtotal * (taxPercent / 100)
     );

     export const totalSelector = createSelector(
       subtotalSelector,
       taxSelector,
       (subtotal, tax) => ({ total: subtotal + tax })
     );

     let exampleState = {
       shop: {
         taxPercent: 8,
         items: [
           { name: "apple", value: 1.2 },
           { name: "orange", value: 0.95 },
         ],
       },
     };

     console.log(subtotalSelector(exampleState)); // 2.15
     console.log(taxSelector(exampleState)); // 0.172
     console.log(totalSelector(exampleState)); // { total: 2.322 }
     ```

155. ### Can Redux only be used with React?

     Redux can be used as a data store for any UI layer. The most common usage is with React and React Native, but there are bindings available for Angular, Angular 2, Vue, Mithril, and more. Redux simply provides a subscription mechanism which can be used by any other code.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

156. ### Do you need to have a particular build tool to use Redux?

     Redux is originally written in ES6 and transpiled for production into ES5 with Webpack and Babel. You should be able to use it regardless of your JavaScript build process. Redux also offers a UMD build that can be used directly without any build process at all.

157. ### How Redux Form `initialValues` get updated from state?

     You need to add `enableReinitialize : true` setting.

     ```javascript
     const InitializeFromStateForm = reduxForm({
       form: "initializeFromState",
       enableReinitialize: true,
     })(UserEdit);
     ```

     If your `initialValues` prop gets updated, your form will update too.

158. ### How React PropTypes allow different types for one prop?

     You can use `oneOfType()` method of `PropTypes`.

     For example, the height property can be defined with either `string` or `number` type as below:

     ```javascript
     Component.propTypes = {
       size: PropTypes.oneOfType([PropTypes.string, PropTypes.number]),
     };
     ```

159. ### Can I import an SVG file as react component?

     You can import SVG directly as component instead of loading it as a file. This feature is available with `react-scripts@2.0.0` and higher.

     ```jsx harmony
     import { ReactComponent as Logo } from "./logo.svg";

     const App = () => (
       <div>
         {/* Logo is an actual react component */}
         <Logo />
       </div>
     );
     ```

     **Note**: Don't forget about the curly braces in the import.

160. ### What is render hijacking in react?

     The concept of render hijacking is the ability to control what a component will output from another component. It means that you decorate your component by wrapping it into a Higher-Order component. By wrapping, you can inject additional props or make other changes, which can cause changing logic of rendering. It does not actually enable hijacking, but by using HOC you make your component behave differently.

161. ### How to pass numbers to React component?

     We can pass `numbers` as `props` to React component using curly braces `{}` where as `strings` in double quotes `""` or single quotes `''`

     ```jsx
     import React from "react";

     const ChildComponent = ({ name, age }) => {
       return (
         <>
           My Name is {name} and Age is {age}
         </>
       );
     };

     const ParentComponent = () => {
       return (
         <>
           <ChildComponent name="Chetan" age={30} />
         </>
       );
     };

     export default ParentComponent;
     ```

162. ### Do I need to keep all my state into Redux? Should I ever use react internal state?

     It is up to the developer's decision, i.e., it is developer's job to determine what kinds of state make up your application, and where each piece of state should live. Some users prefer to keep every single piece of data in Redux, to maintain a fully serializable and controlled version of their application at all times. Others prefer to keep non-critical or UI state, such as “is this dropdown currently open”, inside a component's internal state.

     Below are the rules of thumb to determine what kind of data should be put into Redux

     1. Do other parts of the application care about this data?
     2. Do you need to be able to create further derived data based on this original data?
     3. Is the same data being used to drive multiple components?
     4. Is there value to you in being able to restore this state to a given point in time (ie, time travel debugging)?
     5. Do you want to cache the data (i.e, use what's in state if it's already there instead of re-requesting it)?

163. ### What is the purpose of registerServiceWorker in React?

     React creates a service worker for you without any configuration by default. The service worker is a web API that helps you cache your assets and other files so that when the user is offline or on a slow network, he/she can still see results on the screen, as such, it helps you build a better user experience, that's what you should know about service worker for now. It's all about adding offline capabilities to your site.

     ```jsx
     import React from "react";
     import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
     import App from "./App";
     import registerServiceWorker from "./registerServiceWorker";

     ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById("root"));
     registerServiceWorker();
     ```

164. ### What is React memo function?

     Class components can be restricted from re-rendering when their input props are the same using **PureComponent or shouldComponentUpdate**. Now you can do the same with function components by wrapping them in **React.memo**.

     ```jsx
     const MyComponent = React.memo(function MyComponent(props) {
       /* only rerenders if props change */
     });
     ```

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

165. ### What is React lazy function?

     The `React.lazy` function lets you render a dynamic import as a regular component. It will automatically load the bundle containing the `OtherComponent` when the component gets rendered. This must return a Promise which resolves to a module with a default export containing a React component.

     ```jsx
     const OtherComponent = React.lazy(() => import("./OtherComponent"));

     function MyComponent() {
       return (
         <div>
           <OtherComponent />
         </div>
       );
     }
     ```

     **Note:**
     `React.lazy` and `Suspense` is not yet available for server-side rendering. If you want to do code-splitting in a server rendered app, we still recommend React Loadable.

166. ### How to prevent unnecessary updates using setState?

     You can compare the current value of the state with an existing state value and decide whether to rerender the page or not. If the values are the same then you need to return **null** to stop re-rendering otherwise return the latest state value.

     For example, the user profile information is conditionally rendered as follows,

     ```jsx
     getUserProfile = (user) => {
       const latestAddress = user.address;
       this.setState((state) => {
         if (state.address === latestAddress) {
           return null;
         } else {
           return { title: latestAddress };
         }
       });
     };
     ```

167. ### How do you render Array, Strings and Numbers in React 16 Version?

     **Arrays**: Unlike older releases, you don't need to make sure **render** method return a single element in React16. You are able to return multiple sibling elements without a wrapping element by returning an array.

     For example, let us take the below list of developers,

     ```jsx
     const ReactJSDevs = () => {
       return [
         <li key="1">John</li>,
         <li key="2">Jackie</li>,
         <li key="3">Jordan</li>,
       ];
     };
     ```

     You can also merge this array of items in another array component.

     ```jsx
     const JSDevs = () => {
       return (
         <ul>
           <li>Brad</li>
           <li>Brodge</li>
           <ReactJSDevs />
           <li>Brandon</li>
         </ul>
       );
     };
     ```

     **Strings and Numbers:** You can also return string and number type from the render method.

     ```jsx
     render() {
      return 'Welcome to ReactJS questions';
     }
     // Number
     render() {
      return 2018;
     }
     ```

168. ### What are hooks?

     Hooks is a special JavaScript function that allows you use state and other React features without writing a class. This pattern has been introduced as a new feature in React 16.8 and helped to isolate the stateful logic from the components.

     Let's see an example of useState hook:

     ```jsx
     import { useState } from "react";

     function Example() {
       // Declare a new state variable, which we'll call "count"
       const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

       return (
         <>
           <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
           <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Click me</button>
         </>
       );
     }
     ```

     **Note:** Hooks can be used inside an existing function component without rewriting the component.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

169. ### What rules need to be followed for hooks?

     You need to follow two rules in order to use hooks,

     1. **Call Hooks only at the top level of your react functions:** You should always use hooks at the top level of react function before any early returns. i.e, You shouldn’t call Hooks inside loops, conditions, or nested functions. This will ensure that Hooks are called in the same order each time a component renders and it preserves the state of Hooks between multiple re-renders due to `useState` and `useEffect` calls.

     Let's see the difference using an example,
     **Correct usage:**:
     ```jsx
     function UserProfile() {
      // Correct: Hooks called at the top level
      const [name, setName] = useState('John');
      const [country, setCountry] = useState('US');

      return (
        <div>
          <h1>Name: {name}</h1>
          <p>Country: {country}</p>
        </div>
      );
     }
     ```
     **Incorrect usage:**:
     ```jsx
     function UserProfile() {
      const [name, setName] = useState('John');

      if (name === 'John') {
        // Incorrect: useState is called inside a conditional
        const [country, setCountry] = useState('US'); 
      }

      return (
        <div>
          <h1>Name: {name}</h1>
          <p>Country: {country}</p> {/* This will throw an error if the name condition isn't met */}
        </div>
      );
     }
     ```
     The `useState` hook for the country field is being called conditionally within an `if` block. This can lead to inconsistent state behavior and may cause hooks to be called in a different order on each re-render.

     2. **Call Hooks from React Functions only:** You shouldn’t call Hooks from regular JavaScript functions or class components. Instead, you should call them from either function components or custom hooks.

     Let's find the difference of correct and incorrect usage with below examples,

     **Correct usage:**:
     ```jsx
     //Example1:
     function Counter() {
      // Correct: useState is used inside a functional component
      const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

      return <div>Counter: {count}</div>;
     }
     //Example2:
     function useFetchData(url) {
      const [data, setData] = useState(null);

      useEffect(() => {
        fetch(url)
          .then((response) => response.json())
          .then((data) => setData(data));
      }, [url]);

      return data;
     }

     function UserProfile() {
      // Correct: Using a custom hook here
      const user = useFetchData('https://some-api.com/user');

      return (
        <div>
          <h1>{user ? user.name : 'Loading profile...'}</h1>
        </div>
      );
     }
     ```
     **Incorrect usage:**:
     ```jsx
      //Example1
      function normalFunction() {
        // Incorrect: Can't call hooks in normal functions
        const [count, setCount] = useState(0); 
      }

      //Example2
      function fetchData(url) {
        // Incorrect: Hooks can't be used in non-React functions
        const [data, setData] = useState(null);

        useEffect(() => {
          fetch(url)
            .then((response) => response.json())
            .then((data) => setData(data));
        }, [url]);

        return data;
      }
     ```
     In the above incorrect usage example, both `useState` and `useEffect` are used in non-React functions(`normalFunction` and `fetchData`), which is not allowed.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

170.   ### How to ensure hooks followed the rules in your project?

        React team released an ESLint plugin called **eslint-plugin-react-hooks** that enforces Hook's two rules. It is part of Hooks API. You can add this plugin to your project using the below command,

        ```javascript
        npm install eslint-plugin-react-hooks --save-dev
        ```

        And apply the below config in your ESLint config file,

        ```javascript
        // Your ESLint configuration
        {
          "plugins": [
            // ...
            "react-hooks"
          ],
          "rules": {
            // ...
            "react-hooks/rules-of-hooks": "error"
          }
        }
        ```

        This plugin also provide another important rule through `react-hooks/exhaustive-deps`. It ensures that the dependencies of useEffect, useCallback, and useMemo hooks are correctly listed to avoid potential bugs.

        ```jsx
        useEffect(() => {
          // Forgetting `message` will result in incorrect behavior
          console.log(message);
        }, []); // Here `message` should be a dependency
        ```
        The recommended `eslint-config-react-app` preset already includes the hooks rules of this plugin.
        For example, the linter enforce proper naming convention for hooks. If you rename your custom hooks which as prefix "use" to something else then linter won't allow you to call built-in hooks such as useState, useEffect etc inside of your custom hook anymore.

        **Note:** This plugin is intended to use in Create React App by default.

171. ### What are the differences between Flux and Redux?

     Below are the major differences between Flux and Redux

     | Flux                                           | Redux                                      |
     | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
     | State is mutable                               | State is immutable                         |
     | The Store contains both state and change logic | The Store and change logic are separate    |
     | There are multiple stores exist                | There is only one store exist              |
     | All the stores are disconnected and flat       | Single store with hierarchical reducers    |
     | It has a singleton dispatcher                  | There is no concept of dispatcher          |
     | React components subscribe to the store        | Container components uses connect function |

172. ### What are the benefits of React Router V4?

     Below are the main benefits of React Router V4 module,

     1. In React Router v4(version 4), the API is completely about components. A router can be visualized as a single component(`<BrowserRouter>`) which wraps specific child router components(`<Route>`).
     2. You don't need to manually set history. The router module will take care history by wrapping routes with `<BrowserRouter>` component.
     3. The application size is reduced by adding only the specific router module(Web, core, or native)

173. ### Can you describe about componentDidCatch lifecycle method signature?

     The **componentDidCatch** lifecycle method is invoked after an error has been thrown by a descendant component. The method receives two parameters,

     1. error: - The error object which was thrown
     2. info: - An object with a componentStack key contains the information about which component threw the error.

     The method structure would be as follows

     ```javascript
     componentDidCatch(error, info);
     ```

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

174. ### In which scenarios do error boundaries not catch errors?

     Below are the cases in which error boundaries don't work,

     1. Inside Event handlers
     2. Asynchronous code using **setTimeout or requestAnimationFrame** callbacks
     3. During Server side rendering
     4. When errors thrown in the error boundary code itself

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

175. ### What is the behavior of uncaught errors in react 16?
     In React 16, errors that were not caught by any error boundary will result in unmounting of the whole React component tree. The reason behind this decision is that it is worse to leave corrupted UI in place than to completely remove it. For example, it is worse for a payments app to display a wrong amount than to render nothing.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

176. ### What is the proper placement for error boundaries?
     The granularity of error boundaries usage is up to the developer based on project needs. You can follow either of these approaches,
     1. You can wrap top-level route components to display a generic error message for the entire application.
     2. You can also wrap individual components in an error boundary to protect them from crashing the rest of the application.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

177. ### What is the benefit of component stack trace from error boundary?

     Apart from error messages and javascript stack, React16 will display the component stack trace with file names and line numbers using error boundary concept.

     For example, BuggyCounter component displays the component stack trace as below,

     ![stacktrace](images/error_boundary.png)

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

178. ### What are default props?

     The _defaultProps_ can be defined as a property on the component to set the default values for the props. These default props are used when props not supplied(i.e., undefined props), but not for `null` or `0` as props. That means, If you provide null value then it remains null value. It's the same behavior with 0 as well.

     For example, let us create color default prop for the button component,

     ```javascript
     function MyButton {
       // ...
     }

     MyButton.defaultProps = {
       color: "red",
     };
     ```

     If `props.color` is not provided then it will set the default value to 'red'. i.e, Whenever you try to access the color prop it uses the default value

     ```javascript
     function MyButton() {
       return <MyButton />; // props.color will contain red value
     }
     ```

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

179. ### What is the purpose of displayName class property?

     The displayName string is used in debugging messages. Usually, you don’t need to set it explicitly because it’s inferred from the name of the function or class that defines the component. You might want to set it explicitly if you want to display a different name for debugging purposes or when you create a higher-order component.

     For example, To ease debugging, choose a display name that communicates that it’s the result of a withSubscription HOC.

     ```javascript
     function withSubscription(WrappedComponent) {
       class WithSubscription extends React.Component {
         /* ... */
       }
       WithSubscription.displayName = `WithSubscription(${getDisplayName(
         WrappedComponent
       )})`;
       return WithSubscription;
     }
     function getDisplayName(WrappedComponent) {
       return (
         WrappedComponent.displayName || WrappedComponent.name || "Component"
       );
     }
     ```

180. ### What is the browser support for react applications?
     React supports all popular browsers, including Internet Explorer 9 and above, although some polyfills are required for older browsers such as IE 9 and IE 10. If you use **es5-shim and es5-sham** polyfill then it even support old browsers that doesn't support ES5 methods.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

181. ### What is code-splitting?

     Code-Splitting is a feature supported by bundlers like Webpack and Browserify which can create multiple bundles that can be dynamically loaded at runtime. The react project supports code splitting via dynamic import() feature.

     For example, in the below code snippets, it will make moduleA.js and all its unique dependencies as a separate chunk that only loads after the user clicks the 'Load' button.

     **moduleA.js**

     ```javascript
     const moduleA = "Hello";

     export { moduleA };
     ```

     **App.js**

     ```javascript
     export default function App {
       function handleClick() {
         import("./moduleA")
           .then(({ moduleA }) => {
             // Use moduleA
           })
           .catch((err) => {
             // Handle failure
           });
       };

      return (
        <div>
          <button onClick={this.handleClick}>Load</button>
        </div>
      );
     }
     ```

  <details><summary><b>See Class</b></summary>
    <p>

  ```javascript
    import React, { Component } from "react";

     class App extends Component {
       handleClick = () => {
         import("./moduleA")
           .then(({ moduleA }) => {
             // Use moduleA
           })
           .catch((err) => {
             // Handle failure
           });
       };

       render() {
         return (
           <div>
             <button onClick={this.handleClick}>Load</button>
           </div>
         );
       }
     }

     export default App;
  ```

182. ### What are Keyed Fragments?

     The Fragments declared with the explicit <React.Fragment> syntax may have keys. The general use case is mapping a collection to an array of fragments as below,

     ```javascript
     function Glossary(props) {
       return (
         <dl>
           {props.items.map((item) => (
             // Without the `key`, React will fire a key warning
             <React.Fragment key={item.id}>
               <dt>{item.term}</dt>
               <dd>{item.description}</dd>
             </React.Fragment>
           ))}
         </dl>
       );
     }
     ```

     **Note:** key is the only attribute that can be passed to Fragment. In the future, there might be a support for additional attributes, such as event handlers.

183. ### Does React support all HTML attributes?

     As of React 16, both standard or custom DOM attributes are fully supported. Since React components often take both custom and DOM-related props, React uses the camelCase convention just like the DOM APIs.

     Let us take few props with respect to standard HTML attributes,

     ```javascript
     <div tabIndex="-1" />      // Just like node.tabIndex DOM API
     <div className="Button" /> // Just like node.className DOM API
     <input readOnly={true} />  // Just like node.readOnly DOM API
     ```

     These props work similarly to the corresponding HTML attributes, with the exception of the special cases. It also support all SVG attributes.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

184. ### When component props defaults to true?

     If you pass no value for a prop, it defaults to true. This behavior is available so that it matches the behavior of HTML.

     For example, below expressions are equivalent,

     ```javascript
     <MyInput autocomplete />

     <MyInput autocomplete={true} />
     ```

     **Note:** It is not recommended to use this approach because it can be confused with the ES6 object shorthand (example, `{name}` which is short for `{name: name}`)

185. ### What is NextJS and major features of it?

     Next.js is a popular and lightweight framework for static and server‑rendered applications built with React. It also provides styling and routing solutions. Below are the major features provided by NextJS,

     1. Server-rendered by default
     2. Automatic code splitting for faster page loads
     3. Simple client-side routing (page based)
     4. Webpack-based dev environment which supports (HMR)
     5. Able to implement with Express or any other Node.js HTTP server
     6. Customizable with your own Babel and Webpack configurations

186. ### How do you pass an event handler to a component?

     You can pass event handlers and other functions as props to child components. The functions can be passed to child component as below,

     ```jsx
     function Button({ onClick }) {
       return <button onClick={onClick}>Download</button>;
     }

     export default function downloadExcel() {
       function handleClick() {
         alert("Downloaded");
       }

       return <Button onClick={handleClick}></Button>;
     }
     ```

187. ### How to prevent a function from being called multiple times?

     If you use an event handler such as **onClick or onScroll** and want to prevent the callback from being fired too quickly, then you can limit the rate at which callback is executed. This can be achieved in the below possible ways,

     1. **Throttling:** Changes based on a time based frequency. For example, it can be used using \_.throttle lodash function
     2. **Debouncing:** Publish changes after a period of inactivity. For example, it can be used using \_.debounce lodash function
     3. **RequestAnimationFrame throttling:** Changes based on requestAnimationFrame. For example, it can be used using raf-schd lodash function

188. ### How JSX prevents Injection Attacks?

     React DOM escapes any values embedded in JSX before rendering them. Thus it ensures that you can never inject anything that’s not explicitly written in your application. Everything is converted to a string before being rendered.

     For example, you can embed user input as below,

     ```javascript
     const name = response.potentiallyMaliciousInput;
     const element = <h1>{name}</h1>;
     ```

     This way you can prevent XSS(Cross-site-scripting) attacks in the application.

189. ### How do you update rendered elements?

     You can update UI(represented by rendered element) by passing the newly created element to ReactDOM's render method.

     For example, lets take a ticking clock example, where it updates the time by calling render method multiple times,

     ```javascript
     function tick() {
       const element = (
         <div>
           <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
           <h2>It is {new Date().toLocaleTimeString()}.</h2>
         </div>
       );
       ReactDOM.render(element, document.getElementById("root"));
     }

     setInterval(tick, 1000);
     ```

190. ### How do you say that props are readonly?

     When you declare a component as a function or a class, it must never modify its own props.

     Let us take a below capital function,

     ```javascript
     function capital(amount, interest) {
       return amount + interest;
     }
     ```

     The above function is called “pure” because it does not attempt to change their inputs, and always return the same result for the same inputs. Hence, React has a single rule saying "All React components must act like pure functions with respect to their props."

191. ### What are the conditions to safely use the index as a key?

     There are three conditions to make sure, it is safe use the index as a key.

     1. The list and items are static– they are not computed and do not change
     2. The items in the list have no ids
     3. The list is never reordered or filtered.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

192. ### Should keys be globally unique?

     The keys used within arrays should be unique among their siblings but they don’t need to be globally unique. i.e, You can use the same keys with two different arrays.

     For example, the below `Book` component uses two arrays with different arrays,

     ```javascript
     function Book(props) {
       const index = (
         <ul>
           {props.pages.map((page) => (
             <li key={page.id}>{page.title}</li>
           ))}
         </ul>
       );
       const content = props.pages.map((page) => (
         <div key={page.id}>
           <h3>{page.title}</h3>
           <p>{page.content}</p>
           <p>{page.pageNumber}</p>
         </div>
       ));
       return (
         <div>
           {index}
           <hr />
           {content}
         </div>
       );
     }
     ```

193. ### What is the popular choice for form handling?

     `Formik` is a form library for react which provides solutions such as validation, keeping track of the visited fields, and handling form submission.

     In detail, You can categorize them as follows,

     1. Getting values in and out of form state
     2. Validation and error messages
     3. Handling form submission

     It is used to create a scalable, performant, form helper with a minimal API to solve annoying stuff.

194. ### What are the advantages of formik over redux form library?

     Below are the main reasons to recommend formik over redux form library,

     1. The form state is inherently short-term and local, so tracking it in Redux (or any kind of Flux library) is unnecessary.
     2. Redux-Form calls your entire top-level Redux reducer multiple times ON EVERY SINGLE KEYSTROKE. This way it increases input latency for large apps.
     3. Redux-Form is 22.5 kB minified gzipped whereas Formik is 12.7 kB

195. ### Why are you not required to use inheritance?
     In React, it is recommended to use composition over inheritance to reuse code between components. Both Props and composition give you all the flexibility you need to customize a component’s look and behavior explicitly and safely.
     Whereas, If you want to reuse non-UI functionality between components, it is suggested to extract it into a separate JavaScript module. Later components import it and use that function, object, or class, without extending it.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

196. ### Can I use web components in react application?

     Yes, you can use web components in a react application. Even though many developers won't use this combination, it may require especially if you are using third-party UI components that are written using Web Components.

     For example, let us use `Vaadin` date picker web component as below,

     ```javascript
     import "./App.css";
     import "@vaadin/vaadin-date-picker";
     export default function App() {
       return (
         <div className="App">
           <vaadin-date-picker label="When were you born?"></vaadin-date-picker>
         </div>
       );
     }
     ```

197. ### What is dynamic import?

     You can achieve code-splitting in your app using dynamic import.

     Let's take an example of addition,

     1. **Normal Import**

     ```javascript
     import { add } from "./math";
     console.log(add(10, 20));
     ```

     2. **Dynamic Import**

     ```javascript
     import("./math").then((math) => {
       console.log(math.add(10, 20));
     });
     ```

198. ### What are loadable components?

     With the release of React 18, React.lazy and Suspense are now available for server-side rendering. However, prior to React 18, it was recommended to use Loadable Components for code-splitting in a server-side rendered app because React.lazy and Suspense were not available for server-side rendering. Loadable Components lets you render a dynamic import as a regular component. For example, you can use Loadable Components to load the OtherComponent in a separate bundle like this:

     ```javascript
     import loadable from "@loadable/component";

     const OtherComponent = loadable(() => import("./OtherComponent"));

     function MyComponent() {
       return (
         <div>
           <OtherComponent />
         </div>
       );
     }
     ```

     Now OtherComponent will be loaded in a separated bundle
     Loadable Components provides additional benefits beyond just code-splitting, such as automatic code reloading, error handling, and preloading. By using Loadable Components, you can ensure that your application loads quickly and efficiently, providing a better user experience for your users.

199. ### What is suspense component?

     React Suspense is a built-in feature that lets you defer rendering part of your component tree until some condition(asynchronous operation) is met—usually, data or code has finished loading. While waiting, Suspense lets you display a fallback UI like a spinner or placeholder.


     1. Lazy loading components uses suspense feature,


        If the module containing the dynamic import is not yet loaded by the time parent component renders, you must show some fallback content while you’re waiting for it to load using a loading indicator. This can be done using **Suspense** component.
    
        ```javascript
        const OtherComponent = React.lazy(() => import("./OtherComponent"));

        function MyComponent() {
          return (
            <div>
              <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
                <OtherComponent />
              </Suspense>
            </div>
          );
        }
        ```
        The above component shows fallback UI instead real component until `OtherComponent` is fully loaded.

     2. As an another example, suspend until async data(data fetching) is ready
      ```jsx
        function UserProfile() {
          const user = use(fetchUser()); // throws a promise internally
          return <div>{user.name}</div>;
        }

        function App() {
          return (
            <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading user...</div>}>
              <UserProfile />
            </Suspense>
          );
        }

    ```

200. ### What is route based code splitting?

     One of the best place to do code splitting is with routes. The entire page is going to re-render at once so users are unlikely to interact with other elements in the page at the same time. Due to this, the user experience won't be disturbed.

     Let us take an example of route based website using libraries like React Router with React.lazy,

     ```javascript
     import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Switch } from "react-router-dom";
     import React, { Suspense, lazy } from "react";

     const Home = lazy(() => import("./routes/Home"));
     const About = lazy(() => import("./routes/About"));

     const App = () => (
       <Router>
         <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
           <Switch>
             <Route exact path="/" component={Home} />
             <Route path="/about" component={About} />
           </Switch>
         </Suspense>
       </Router>
     );
     ```

     In the above code, the code splitting will happen at each route level.

201. ### What is the purpose of default value in context?

     The defaultValue argument is only used when a component does not have a matching Provider above it in the tree. This can be helpful for testing components in isolation without wrapping them.

     Below code snippet provides default theme value as Luna.

     ```javascript
     const MyContext = React.createContext(defaultValue);
     ```

202. ### What is diffing algorithm?

     React needs to use algorithms to find out how to efficiently update the UI to match the most recent tree. The diffing algorithms is generating the minimum number of operations to transform one tree into another. However, the algorithms have a complexity in the order of O(n³) where n is the number of elements in the tree.

     In this case, displaying 1000 elements would require in the order of one billion comparisons. This is far too expensive. Instead, React implements a heuristic O(n) algorithm based on two assumptions:

     1. Two elements of different types will produce different trees.
     2. The developer can hint at which child elements may be stable across different renders with a key prop.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

203. ### What are the rules covered by diffing algorithm?

     When diffing two trees, React first compares the two root elements. The behavior is different depending on the types of the root elements. It covers the below rules during reconciliation algorithm,

     1. **Elements Of Different Types:**
        Whenever the root elements have different types, React will tear down the old tree and build the new tree from scratch. For example, elements <a> to <img>, or from <Article> to <Comment> of different types lead a full rebuild.
     2. **DOM Elements Of The Same Type:**
        When comparing two React DOM elements of the same type, React looks at the attributes of both, keeps the same underlying DOM node, and only updates the changed attributes. Lets take an example with same DOM elements except className attribute,

        ```javascript
        <div className="show" title="ReactJS" />

        <div className="hide" title="ReactJS" />
        ```

     3. **Component Elements Of The Same Type:**
        When a component updates, the instance stays the same, so that state is maintained across renders. React updates the props of the underlying component instance to match the new element, and calls componentWillReceiveProps() and componentWillUpdate() on the underlying instance. After that, the render() method is called and the diff algorithm recurses on the previous result and the new result.
     4. **Recursing On Children:**
        when recursing on the children of a DOM node, React just iterates over both lists of children at the same time and generates a mutation whenever there’s a difference. For example, when adding an element at the end of the children, converting between these two trees works well.

        ```javascript
        <ul>
          <li>first</li>
          <li>second</li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
          <li>first</li>
          <li>second</li>
          <li>third</li>
        </ul>

        ```

     5. **Handling keys:**
        React supports a key attribute. When children have keys, React uses the key to match children in the original tree with children in the subsequent tree. For example, adding a key can make the tree conversion efficient,

     ```javascript
     <ul>
       <li key="2015">Duke</li>
       <li key="2016">Villanova</li>
     </ul>

     <ul>
       <li key="2014">Connecticut</li>
       <li key="2015">Duke</li>
       <li key="2016">Villanova</li>
     </ul>
     ```

204. ### When do you need to use refs?

     There are few use cases to go for refs,

     1. Managing focus, text selection, or media playback.
     2. Triggering imperative animations.
     3. Integrating with third-party DOM libraries.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

205. ### Must prop be named as render for render props?

     Even though the pattern named render props, you don’t have to use a prop named render to use this pattern. i.e, Any prop that is a function that a component uses to know what to render is technically a “render prop”. Lets take an example with the children prop for render props,

     ```javascript
     <Mouse
       children={(mouse) => (
         <p>
           The mouse position is {mouse.x}, {mouse.y}
         </p>
       )}
     />
     ```

     Actually children prop doesn’t need to be named in the list of “attributes” in JSX element. Instead, you can keep it directly inside element,

     ```javascript
     <Mouse>
       {(mouse) => (
         <p>
           The mouse position is {mouse.x}, {mouse.y}
         </p>
       )}
     </Mouse>
     ```

     While using this above technique(without any name), explicitly state that children should be a function in your propTypes.

     ```javascript
     Mouse.propTypes = {
       children: PropTypes.func.isRequired,
     };
     ```

206. ### What are the problems of using render props with pure components?
     If you create a function inside a render method, it negates the purpose of pure component. Because the shallow prop comparison will always return false for new props, and each render in this case will generate a new value for the render prop. You can solve this issue by defining the render function as instance method.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

207. ### What is windowing technique?
     Windowing is a technique that only renders a small subset of your rows at any given time, and can dramatically reduce the time it takes to re-render the components as well as the number of DOM nodes created. If your application renders long lists of data then this technique is recommended. Both react-window and react-virtualized are popular windowing libraries which provides several reusable components for displaying lists, grids, and tabular data.

208. ### How do you print falsy values in JSX?

     The falsy values such as false, null, undefined, and true are valid children but they don't render anything. If you still want to display them then you need to convert it to string. Let's take an example on how to convert to a string,

     ```javascript
     <div>My JavaScript variable is {String(myVariable)}.</div>
     ```

209. ### What is the typical use case of portals?
     React Portals are primarily used to render UI components such as **modals, tooltips, dropdowns, hovercards, and notifications** outside of their parent component's DOM tree. This helps avoid common CSS issues caused by parent elements, such as:

     *   `**overflow: hidden**` on parent elements clipping or hiding child elements like modals or tooltips,
     *   **stacking context and** `**z-index**` **conflicts** created by parent containers that prevent child elements from appearing above other content.

     That means, you need to visually “break out” of its container. By rendering these UI elements into a separate DOM node (often directly under `<body>`), portals ensure they appear above all other content and are not restricted by the parent’s CSS or layout constraints, resulting in correct positioning and visibility regardless of the parent’s styling.

210.   ### How do you set default value for uncontrolled component?

     In React, the value attribute on form elements will override the value in the DOM. With an uncontrolled component, you might want React to specify the initial value, but leave subsequent updates uncontrolled. To handle this case, you can specify a **defaultValue** attribute instead of **value**.

     ```javascript
     render() {
       return (
         <form onSubmit={this.handleSubmit}>
           <label>
             User Name:
             <input
               defaultValue="John"
               type="text"
               ref={this.input} />
           </label>
           <input type="submit" value="Submit" />
         </form>
       );
     }
     ```

     The same applies for `select` and `textArea` inputs. But you need to use **defaultChecked** for `checkbox` and `radio` inputs.

211. ### What is your favorite React stack?
     Even though the tech stack varies from developer to developer, the most popular stack is used in react boilerplate project code. It mainly uses Redux and redux-saga for state management and asynchronous side-effects, react-router for routing purpose, styled-components for styling react components, axios for invoking REST api, and other supported stack such as webpack, reselect, ESNext, Babel.
     You can clone the project https://github.com/react-boilerplate/react-boilerplate and start working on any new react project.

212. ### What is the difference between Real DOM and Virtual DOM?

     Below are the main differences between Real DOM and Virtual DOM,

     | Real DOM                             | Virtual DOM                          |
     | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
     | Updates are slow                     | Updates are fast                     |
     | DOM manipulation is very expensive.  | DOM manipulation is very easy        |
     | You can update HTML directly.        | You Can’t directly update HTML       |
     | It causes too much of memory wastage | There is no memory wastage           |
     | Creates a new DOM if element updates | It updates the JSX if element update |

213. ### How to add Bootstrap to a react application?

     Bootstrap can be added to your React app in a three possible ways,

     1. Using the Bootstrap CDN:
        This is the easiest way to add bootstrap. Add both bootstrap CSS and JS resources in a head tag.
     2. Bootstrap as Dependency:
        If you are using a build tool or a module bundler such as Webpack, then this is the preferred option for adding Bootstrap to your React application
        ```javascript
        npm install bootstrap
        ```
     3. React Bootstrap Package:
        In this case, you can add Bootstrap to our React app is by using a package that has rebuilt Bootstrap components to work particularly as React components. Below packages are popular in this category,
        1. react-bootstrap

215. ### Is it recommended to use CSS In JS technique in React?
     React does not have any opinion about how styles are defined but if you are a beginner then good starting point is to define your styles in a separate \*.css file as usual and refer to them using className. This functionality is not part of React but came from third-party libraries. But If you want to try a different approach(CSS-In-JS) then styled-components library is a good option.

216. ### Do I need to rewrite all my class components with hooks?
     No. But you can try Hooks in a few components(or new components) without rewriting any existing code. Because there are no plans to remove classes in ReactJS.

217. ### What is useEffect hook? How to fetch data with React Hooks?

     The `useEffect` hook is a React Hook that lets you perform **side effects** in function components. Side effects are operations that interact with the outside world or system and aren't directly related to rendering UI — such as fetching data, setting up subscriptions, timers, manually manipulating the DOM, etc.

     In function components, useEffect replaces the class component lifecycle methods(`componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate` and `componentWillUnmount`) with a single, unified API.     

     **Syntax**
     ```js
     useEffect(() => {
        // Side effect logic here

        return () => {
        // Cleanup logic (optional)
        };
        }, [dependencies]);
     ```
     This effect hook can be used to fetch data from an API and to set the data in the local state of the component with the useState hook’s update function.

     Here is an example of fetching a list of ReactJS articles from an API using fetch.

     ```javascript
     import React from "react";

     function App() {
       const [data, setData] = React.useState({ hits: [] });

       React.useEffect(() => {
         fetch("http://hn.algolia.com/api/v1/search?query=react")
           .then((response) => response.json())
           .then((data) => setData(data));
       }, []);

       return (
         <ul>
           {data.hits.map((item) => (
             <li key={item.objectID}>
               <a href={item.url}>{item.title}</a>
             </li>
           ))}
         </ul>
       );
     }

     export default App;
     ```

     A popular way to simplify this is by using the library axios.

     We provided an empty array as second argument to the useEffect hook to avoid activating it on component updates. This way, it only fetches on component mount.

218. ### Is Hooks cover all use cases for classes?
     Hooks doesn't cover all use cases of classes but there is a plan to add them soon. Currently there are no Hook equivalents to the uncommon **getSnapshotBeforeUpdate** and **componentDidCatch** lifecycles yet.

219. ### What is the stable release for hooks support?

     React includes a stable implementation of React Hooks in 16.8 release for below packages

     1. React DOM
     2. React DOM Server
     3. React Test Renderer
     4. React Shallow Renderer

220. ### Why do we use array destructuring (square brackets notation) in `useState`?

     When we declare a state variable with `useState`, it returns a pair — an array with two items. The first item is the current value, and the second is a function that updates the value. Using [0] and [1] to access them is a bit confusing because they have a specific meaning. This is why we use array destructuring instead.

     For example, the array index access would look as follows:

     ```javascript
     var userStateVariable = useState("userProfile"); // Returns an array pair
     var user = userStateVariable[0]; // Access first item
     var setUser = userStateVariable[1]; // Access second item
     ```

     Whereas with array destructuring the variables can be accessed as follows:

     ```javascript
     const [user, setUser] = useState("userProfile");
     ```

221. ### What are the sources used for introducing hooks?

     Hooks got the ideas from several different sources. Below are some of them,

     1. Previous experiments with functional APIs in the react-future repository
     2. Community experiments with render prop APIs such as Reactions Component
     3. State variables and state cells in DisplayScript.
     4. Subscriptions in Rx.
     5. Reducer components in ReasonReact.

222. ### How do you access imperative API of web components?
     Web Components often expose an imperative API to implement its functions. You will need to use a **ref** to interact with the DOM node directly if you want to access imperative API of a web component. But if you are using third-party Web Components, the best solution is to write a React component that behaves as a **wrapper** for your Web Component.

225. ### Do browsers understand JSX code?
     No, browsers can't understand JSX code. You need a transpiler to convert your JSX to regular Javascript that browsers can understand. The most widely used transpiler right now is Babel.

229. ### Should I learn ES6 before learning ReactJS?

     No, you don’t have to learn es2015/es6 to learn react. But you may find many resources or React ecosystem uses ES6 extensively. Let's see some of the frequently used ES6 features,

     1. **Destructuring:** To get props and use them in a component

        ```javascript
        // in es 5
        var someData = this.props.someData;
        var dispatch = this.props.dispatch;

        // in es6
        const { someData, dispatch } = this.props;
        ```

     2. **Spread operator:** Helps in passing props down into a component

        ```javascript
        // in es 5
        <SomeComponent someData={this.props.someData} dispatch={this.props.dispatch} />

        // in es6
        <SomeComponent {...this.props} />
        ```

     3. **Arrow functions:** Makes compact syntax
        ```javascript
        // es 5
        var users = usersList.map(function (user) {
          return <li>{user.name}</li>;
        });
        // es 6
        const users = usersList.map((user) => <li>{user.name}</li>);
        ```

230. ### What is Concurrent Rendering?

     The Concurrent rendering makes React apps to be more responsive by rendering component trees without blocking the main UI thread. It allows React to interrupt a long-running render to handle a high-priority event. i.e, When you enabled concurrent Mode, React will keep an eye on other tasks that need to be done, and if there's something with a higher priority it will pause what it is currently rendering and let the other task finish first. You can enable this in two ways,

     ```javascript
     // 1. Part of an app by wrapping with ConcurrentMode
     <React.unstable_ConcurrentMode>
       <Something />
     </React.unstable_ConcurrentMode>;

     // 2. Whole app using createRoot
     ReactDOM.unstable_createRoot(domNode).render(<App />);
     ```

231. ### What is the difference between async mode and concurrent mode?
     Both refers the same thing. Previously concurrent Mode being referred to as "Async Mode" by React team. The name has been changed to highlight React’s ability to perform work on different priority levels. So it avoids the confusion from other approaches to Async Rendering.

232. ### Can I use javascript urls in react16.9?

     Yes, you can use javascript: URLs but it will log a warning in the console. Because URLs starting with javascript: are dangerous by including unsanitized output in a tag like `<a href>` and create a security hole.

     ```javascript
     const companyProfile = {
       website: "javascript: alert('Your website is hacked')",
     };
     // It will log a warning
     <a href={companyProfile.website}>More details</a>;
     ```

     Remember that the future versions will throw an error for javascript URLs.

233. ### What is the purpose of eslint plugin for hooks?

     The ESLint plugin enforces rules of Hooks to avoid bugs. It assumes that any function starting with ”use” and a capital letter right after it is a Hook. In particular, the rule enforces that,

     1. Calls to Hooks are either inside a PascalCase function (assumed to be a component) or another useSomething function (assumed to be a custom Hook).
     2. Hooks are called in the same order on every render.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

234. ### What is the difference between Imperative and Declarative in React?

     Imagine a simple UI component, such as a "Like" button. When you tap it, it turns blue if it was previously grey, and grey if it was previously blue.

     The imperative way of doing this would be:

     ```javascript
     if (user.likes()) {
       if (hasBlue()) {
         removeBlue();
         addGrey();
       } else {
         removeGrey();
         addBlue();
       }
     }
     ```

     Basically, you have to check what is currently on the screen and handle all the changes necessary to redraw it with the current state, including undoing the changes from the previous state. You can imagine how complex this could be in a real-world scenario.

     In contrast, the declarative approach would be:

     ```javascript
     if (this.state.liked) {
       return <blueLike />;
     } else {
       return <greyLike />;
     }
     ```

     Because the declarative approach separates concerns, this part of it only needs to handle how the UI should look in a specific state, and is therefore much simpler to understand.

235. ### What are the benefits of using TypeScript with ReactJS?

     Below are some of the benefits of using TypeScript with ReactJS,

     1. It is possible to use latest JavaScript features
     2. Use of interfaces for complex type definitions
     3. IDEs such as VS Code was made for TypeScript
     4. Avoid bugs with the ease of readability and Validation

236. ### How do you make sure that user remains authenticated on page refresh while using Context API State Management?

     When a user logs in and reload, to persist the state generally we add the load user action in the useEffect hooks in the main App.js. While using Redux, loadUser action can be easily accessed.

     **App.js**

     ```js
     import { loadUser } from "../actions/auth";
     store.dispatch(loadUser());
     ```

     - But while using **Context API**, to access context in App.js, wrap the AuthState in index.js so that App.js can access the auth context. Now whenever the page reloads, no matter what route you are on, the user will be authenticated as **loadUser** action will be triggered on each re-render.

     **index.js**

     ```js
     import React from "react";
     import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
     import App from "./App";
     import AuthState from "./context/auth/AuthState";

     ReactDOM.render(
       <React.StrictMode>
         <AuthState>
           <App />
         </AuthState>
       </React.StrictMode>,
       document.getElementById("root")
     );
     ```

     **App.js**

     ```js
     const authContext = useContext(AuthContext);

     const { loadUser } = authContext;

     useEffect(() => {
       loadUser();
     }, []);
     ```

     **loadUser**

     ```js
     const loadUser = async () => {
       const token = sessionStorage.getItem("token");

       if (!token) {
         dispatch({
           type: ERROR,
         });
       }
       setAuthToken(token);

       try {
         const res = await axios("/api/auth");

         dispatch({
           type: USER_LOADED,
           payload: res.data.data,
         });
       } catch (err) {
         console.error(err);
       }
     };
     ```

237. ### What are the benefits of new JSX transform?

     There are three major benefits of new JSX transform,

     1. It is possible to use JSX without importing React packages
     2. The compiled output might improve the bundle size in a small amount
     3. The future improvements provides the flexibility to reduce the number of concepts to learn React.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

238. ### How is the new JSX transform different from old transform??

     The new JSX transform doesn’t require React to be in scope. i.e, You don't need to import React package for simple scenarios.

     Let's take an example to look at the main differences between the old and the new transform,

     **Old Transform:**

     ```js
     import React from "react";

     function App() {
       return <h1>Good morning!!</h1>;
     }
     ```

     Now JSX transform convert the above code into regular JavaScript as below,

     ```js
     import React from "react";

     function App() {
       return React.createElement("h1", null, "Good morning!!");
     }
     ```

     **New Transform:**

     The new JSX transform doesn't require any React imports

     ```js
     function App() {
       return <h1>Good morning!!</h1>;
     }
     ```

     Under the hood JSX transform compiles to below code

     ```js
     import { jsx as _jsx } from "react/jsx-runtime";

     function App() {
       return _jsx("h1", { children: "Good morning!!" });
     }
     ```

     **Note:** You still need to import React to use Hooks.

239. ### What are React Server components?

     React Server Component is a way to write React component that gets rendered in the server-side with the purpose of improving React app performance. These components allow us to load components from the backend.

     **Note:** React Server Components is still under development and not recommended for production yet.

240. ### What is prop drilling?
     Prop Drilling is the process by which you pass data from one component of the React Component tree to another by going through other components that do not need the data but only help in passing it around.

241. ### What is the difference between useState and useRef hook?
     1. useState causes components to re-render after state updates whereas useRef doesn’t cause a component to re-render when the value or state changes.
        Essentially, useRef is like a “box” that can hold a mutable value in its (`.current`) property.
     2. useState allows us to update the state inside components. While useRef allows referencing DOM elements and tracking values.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

242. ### What is a wrapper component?

     A wrapper in React is a component that wraps or surrounds another component or group of components. It can be used for a variety of purposes such as adding additional functionality, styling, or layout to the wrapped components.

     For example, consider a simple component that displays a message:

     ```javascript
     const Message = ({ text }) => {
       return <p>{text}</p>;
     };
     ```

     We can create a wrapper component that will add a border to the message component:

     ```javascript
     const MessageWrapper = (props) => {
       return (
         <div style={{ border: "1px solid black" }}>
           <Message {...props} />
         </div>
       );
     };
     ```

     Now we can use the MessageWrapper component instead of the Message component and the message will be displayed with a border:

     ```javascript
     <MessageWrapper text="Hello World" />
     ```

     Wrapper component can also accept its own props and pass them down to the wrapped component, for example, we can create a wrapper component that will add a title to the message component:

     ```javascript
     const MessageWrapperWithTitle = ({ title, ...props }) => {
       return (
         <div>
           <h3>{title}</h3>
           <Message {...props} />
         </div>
       );
     };
     ```

     Now we can use the MessageWrapperWithTitle component and pass title props:

     ```javascript
     <MessageWrapperWithTitle title="My Message" text="Hello World" />
     ```

     This way, the wrapper component can add additional functionality, styling, or layout to the wrapped component while keeping the wrapped component simple and reusable.

243. ### What are the differences between useEffect and useLayoutEffect hooks?

     useEffect and useLayoutEffect are both React hooks that can be used to synchronize a component with an external system, such as a browser API or a third-party library. However, there are some key differences between the two:

     - Timing: useEffect runs after the browser has finished painting, while useLayoutEffect runs synchronously before the browser paints. This means that useLayoutEffect can be used to measure and update layout in a way that feels more synchronous to the user.

     - Browser Paint: useEffect allows browser to paint the changes before running the effect, hence it may cause some visual flicker. useLayoutEffect synchronously runs the effect before browser paints and hence it will avoid visual flicker.

     - Execution Order: The order in which multiple useEffect hooks are executed is determined by React and may not be predictable. However, the order in which multiple useLayoutEffect hooks are executed is determined by the order in which they were called.

     - Error handling: useEffect has a built-in mechanism for handling errors that occur during the execution of the effect, so that it does not crash the entire application. useLayoutEffect does not have this mechanism, and errors that occur during the execution of the effect will crash the entire application.

     In general, it's recommended to use useEffect as much as possible, because it is more performant and less prone to errors. useLayoutEffect should only be used when you need to measure or update layout, and you can't achieve the same result using useEffect.

244. ### What are the differences between Functional and Class Components?

     There are two different ways to create components in ReactJS. The main differences are listed down as below,

     ## 1. Syntax:

     The class components uses ES6 classes to create the components. It uses `render` function to display the HTML content in the webpage.

     The syntax for class component looks like as below.

     ```js
     class App extends React.Component {
       render() {
         return <h1>This is a class component</h1>;
       }
     }
     ```

     **Note:** The **Pascal Case** is the recommended approach to provide naming to a component.

     Functional component has been improved over the years with some added features like Hooks. Here is a syntax for functional component.

     ```js
     function App() {
       return (
         <div className="App">
           <h1>Hello, I'm a function component</h1>
         </div>
       );
     }
     ```

     ## 2. State:

     State contains information or data about a component which may change over time.

     In class component, you can update the state when a user interacts with it or server updates the data using the `setState()` method. The initial state is going to be assigned in the `Constructor()` method using the `this.state` object and it is possible to assign different data types such as string, boolean, numbers, etc.

     **A simple example showing how we use the setState() and constructor():**

     ```js
     class App extends Component {
       constructor() {
         super();
         this.state = {
           message: "This is a class component",
         };
       }
       updateMessage() {
         this.setState({
           message: "Updating the class component",
         });
       }
       render() {
         return (
           <>
             <h1>{this.state.message}</h1>
             <button
               onClick={() => {
                 this.updateMessage();
               }}>
               Click!!
             </button>
           </>
         );
       }
     }

     ```

     You didn't use state in functional components because it was only supported in class components. But over the years hooks have been implemented in functional components which enables to use state too.

     The `useState()` hook can used to implement state in functional components. It returns an array with two items: the first item is current state and the next one is a function (setState) that updates the value of the current state.

     Let's see an example to demonstrate the state in functional components,

     ```js
     function App() {
       const [message, setMessage] = useState("This is a functional component");
       const updateMessage = () => {
         setMessage("Updating the functional component");
       };
       return (
         <div className="App">
           <h1>{message} </h1>
           <button onClick={updateMessage}>Click me!!</button>
         </div>
       );
     }
     ```

     ## 3. Props:

     Props are referred to as "properties". The props are passed into React component just like arguments passed to a function. In other words, they are similar to HTML attributes.

     The props are accessible in child class component using `this.props` as shown in below example,

     ```js
     class Child extends React.Component {
       render() {
         return (
           <h1>
             {" "}
             This is a functional component and component name is {
               this.props.name
             }{" "}
           </h1>
         );
       }
     }

     class Parent extends React.Component {
       render() {
         return (
           <div className="Parent">
             <Child name="First child component" />
             <Child name="Second child component" />
           </div>
         );
       }
     }
     ```

     Props in functional components are similar to that of the class components but the difference is the absence of 'this' keyword.

     ```js
     function Child(props) {
       return (
         <h1>
           This is a child component and the component name is{props.name}
         </h1>
       );
     }

     function Parent() {
       return (
         <div className="Parent">
           <Child name="First child component" />
           <Child name="Second child component" />
         </div>
       );
     }
     ```

245. ### What is strict mode in React?

     `React.StrictMode` is a useful component for highlighting potential problems in an application. Just like `<Fragment>`, `<StrictMode>` does not render any extra DOM elements. It activates additional checks and warnings for its descendants. These checks apply for _development mode_ only.

     ```jsx harmony
     import { StrictMode } from "react";

     function App() {
       return (
         <div>
           <Header />
           <StrictMode>
             <div>
               <ComponentOne />
               <ComponentTwo />
             </div>
           </StrictMode>
           <Header />
         </div>
       );
     }
     ```

     In the example above, the _strict mode_ checks apply to `<ComponentOne>` and `<ComponentTwo>` components only. i.e., Part of the application only.

     **Note:** Frameworks such as NextJS has this flag enabled by default.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

246. ### What is the benefit of strict mode?

     The <StrictMode> will be helpful in the below cases,

     1. To find the bugs caused by impure rendering where the components will re-render twice.
     2. To find the bugs caused by missing cleanup of effects where the components will re-run effects one more extra time.
     3. Identifying components with **unsafe lifecycle methods**.
     4. Warning about **legacy string ref** API usage.
     5. Detecting unexpected **side effects**.
     6. Detecting **legacy context** API.
     7. Warning about deprecated **findDOMNode** usage

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

247. ### Why does strict mode render twice in React?

     StrictMode renders components twice in development mode(not production) in order to detect any problems with your code and warn you about those problems. This is used to detect accidental side effects in the render phase. If you used `create-react-app` development tool then it automatically enables StrictMode by default.

     ```js
     const root = createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
     root.render(
       <StrictMode>
         <App />
       </StrictMode>
     );
     ```

     If you want to disable this behavior then you can simply remove `strict` mode.

     ```js
     const root = createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
     root.render(<App />);
     ```

     To detect side effects the following functions are invoked twice:

     1. Function component bodies, excluding the code inside event handlers.
     2. Functions passed to `useState`, `useMemo`, or `useReducer` (any other Hook)
     3. Class component's `constructor`, `render`, and `shouldComponentUpdate` methods
     4. Class component static `getDerivedStateFromProps` method
     5. State updater functions

248. ### What are the rules of JSX?

     The below 3 rules needs to be followed while using JSX in a react application.

     1. **Return a single root element**:
        If you are returning multiple elements from a component, wrap them in a single parent element. Otherwise you will receive the below error in your browser console.

        `html Adjacent JSX elements must be wrapped in an enclosing tag.`

     2. **All the tags needs to be closed:**
        Unlike HTML, all tags needs to closed explicitly with in JSX. This rule applies for self-closing tags(like hr, br and img tags) as well.
     3. **Use camelCase naming:**
        It is suggested to use camelCase naming for attributes in JSX. For example, the common attributes of HTML elements such as `class`, `tabindex` will be used as `className` and `tabIndex`.  
        **Note:** There is an exception for `aria-*` and `data-*` attributes which should be lower cased all the time.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

249.  ### What is the reason behind multiple JSX tags to be wrapped?

      Behind the scenes, JSX is transformed into plain javascript objects. It is not possible to return two or more objects from a function without wrapping into an array. This is the reason you can't simply return two or more JSX tags from a function without
      wrapping them into a single parent tag or a Fragment.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

250.  ### How do you prevent mutating array variables?

      The preexisting variables outside of the function scope including state, props and context leads to a mutation and they result in unpredictable bugs during the rendering stage. The below points should be taken care while working with arrays variables.

      1. You need to take copy of the original array and perform array operations on it for the rendering purpose. This is called local mutation.
      2. Avoid triggering mutation methods such as push, pop, sort and reverse methods on original array. It is safe to use filter, map and slice method because they create a new array.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

251. ### What are capture phase events?

     The `onClickCapture` React event is helpful to catch all the events of child elements irrespective of event propagation logic or even if the events propagation stopped. This is useful if you need to log every click events for analytics purpose.

     For example, the below code triggers the click event of parent first followed by second level child eventhough leaf child button elements stops the propagation.

     ```jsx
     <div onClickCapture={() => alert("parent")}>
       <div onClickCapture={() => alert("child")}>
         <button onClick={(e) => e.stopPropagation()} />
         <button onClick={(e) => e.stopPropagation()} />
       </div>
     </div>
     ```

     The event propagation for the above code snippet happens in the following order:

     1. It travels downwards in the DOM tree by calling all `onClickCapture` event handlers.
     2. It executes `onClick` event handler on the target element.
     3. It travels upwards in the DOM tree by call all `onClick` event handlers above to it.

252. ### How does React updates screen in an application?

     React updates UI in three steps,

     1. **Triggering or initiating a render:** The component is going to triggered for render in two ways.

        1. **Initial render:** When the app starts, you can trigger the initial render by calling `creatRoot` with the target DOM node followed by invoking component's `render` method. For example, the following code snippet renders `App` component on root DOM node.

        ```jsx
        import { createRoot } from "react-dom/client";

        const root = createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
        root.render(<App />);
        ```

        2. **Re-render when the state updated:** When you update the component state using the state setter function, the componen't state automatically queues for a render.

     2. **Rendering components:** After triggering a render, React will call your components to display them on the screen. React will call the root component for initial render and call the function component whose state update triggered the render. This is a recursive process for all nested components of the target component.

     3. **Commit changes to DOM:** After calling components, React will modify the DOM for initial render using `appendChild()` DOM API and apply minimal necessary DOM updates for re-renders based on differences between rerenders.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

253.  ### How does React batch multiple state updates?

      React prevents component from re-rendering for each and every state update by grouping multiple state updates within an event handler. This strategy improves the application performance and this process known as **batching**. The older version of React only supported batching for browser events whereas React18 supported for asynchronous actions, timeouts and intervals along with native events. This improved version of batching is called **automatic batching**.

      Let's demonstrate this automatic batching feature with a below example.

      ```jsx
      import { useState } from "react";

      export default function BatchingState() {
        const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
        const [message, setMessage] = useState("batching");

        console.log("Application Rendered");

        const handleAsyncFetch = () => {
          fetch("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/1").then(() => {
            // Automatic Batching re-render only once
            setCount(count + 1);
            setMessage("users fetched");
          });
        };

        return (
          <>
            <h1>{count}</h1>
            <button onClick={handleAsyncFetch}>Click Me!</button>
          </>
        );
      }
      ```

      The preceding code updated two state variables with in an event handler. However, React will perform automatic batching feature and the component will be re-rendered only once for better performance.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

254.  ### Is it possible to prevent automatic batching?

      Yes, it is possible to prevent automatic batching default behavior. There might be cases where you need to re-render your component after each state update or updating one state depends on another state variable. Considering this situation, React introduced `flushSync` method from `react-dom` API for the usecases where you need to flush state updates to DOM immediately.

      The usage of `flushSync` method within an `onClick` event handler will be looking like as below,

      ```jsx
      import { flushSync } from "react-dom";

      const handleClick = () => {
        flushSync(() => {
          setClicked(!clicked); //Component will create a re-render here
        });

        setCount(count + 1); // Component will create a re-render again here
      };
      ```

      In the above click handler, React will update DOM at first using flushSync and second time updates DOM because of the counter setter function by avoiding automatic batching.

255.  ### What is React hydration?

      React hydration is used to add client-side JavaScript interactivity to pre-rendered static HTML generated by the server. It is used only for server-side rendering(SSR) to enhance the initial rendering time and make it SEO friendly application. This hydration acts as a bridge to reduce the gap between server side and client-side rendering.

      After the page loaded with generated static HTML, React will add application state and interactivity by attaching all event handlers for the respective elements. Let's demonstrate this with an example.

      Consider that React DOM API(using `renderToString`) generated HTML for `<App>` component which contains `<button>` element to increment the counter.

      ```jsx
      import {useState} from 'react';
      import { renderToString } from 'react-dom/server';

      export default function App() {
        const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0);

        return (
          <h1>Counter</h1>
          <button onClick={() => setCount(prevCount => prevCount + 1)}>
            {count} times
          </button>
          );
      }

      const html = renderToString(<App />);
      ```

      The above code generates the below HTML with a header text and button component without any interactivity.

      ```html
      <h1>Counter</h1>
      <button>
        <!-- -->0<!-- -->
        times
      </button>
      ```

      At this stage `hydrateRoot` API can be used to perform hydration by attaching `onClick` event handler.

      ```jsx
      import { hydrateRoot } from "react-dom/client";
      import App from "./App.js";

      hydrateRoot(document.getElementById("root"), <App />);
      ```

      After this step, you are able to run React application on server-side and hydrating the javascript bundle on client-side for smooth user experience and SEO purposes.

256.  ### How do you update objects inside state?

      You cannot update the objects which exists in the state directly. Instead, you should create a fresh new object (or copy from the existing object) and update the latest state using the newly created object. Eventhough JavaScript objects are mutable, you need to treat objects inside state as read-only while updating the state.

      Let's see this comparison with an example. The issue with regular object mutation approach can be described by updating the user details fields of `Profile` component. The properties of `Profile` component such as firstName, lastName and age details mutated in an event handler as shown below.

      ```jsx
      import { useState } from "react";

      export default function Profile() {
        const [user, setUser] = useState({
          firstName: "John",
          lastName: "Abraham",
          age: 30,
        });

        function handleFirstNameChange(e) {
          user.firstName = e.target.value;
        }

        function handleLastNameChange(e) {
          user.lastName = e.target.value;
        }

        function handleAgeChange(e) {
          user.age = e.target.value;
        }

        return (
          <>
            <label>
              First name:
              <input value={user.firstName} onChange={handleFirstNameChange} />
            </label>
            <label>
              Last name:
              <input value={user.lastName} onChange={handleLastNameChange} />
            </label>
            <label>
              Age:
              <input value={user.age} onChange={handleAgeChange} />
            </label>
            <p>
              Profile:
              {person.firstName} {person.lastName} ({person.age})
            </p>
          </>
        );
      }
      ```

      Once you run the application with above user profile component, you can observe that user profile details won't be update upon entering the input fields.
      This issue can be fixed by creating a new copy of object which includes existing properties through spread syntax(...obj) and add changed values in a single event handler itself as shown below.

      ```jsx
      handleProfileChange(e) {
        setUser({
        ...user,
          [e.target.name]: e.target.value
        });
      }
      ```

      The above event handler is concise instead of maintaining separate event handler for each field. Now, UI displays the updated field values as expected without an issue.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

257.  ### How do you update nested objects inside state?

      You cannot simply use spread syntax for all kinds of objects inside state. Because spread syntax is shallow and it copies properties for one level deep only. If the object has nested object structure, UI doesn't work as expected with regular JavaScript nested property mutation. Let's demonstrate this behavior with an example of User object which has address nested object inside of it.

      ```jsx
      const user = {
        name: "John",
        age: 32,
        address: {
          country: "Singapore",
          postalCode: 440004,
        },
      };
      ```

      If you try to update the country nested field in a regular javascript fashion(as shown below) then user profile screen won't be updated with latest value.

      ```js
      user.address.country = "Germany";
      ```

      This issue can be fixed by flattening all the fields into a top-level object or create a new object for each nested object and point it to it's parent object. In this example, first you need to create copy of address object and update it with the latest value. Later, the address object should be linked to parent user object something like below.

      ```js
      setUser({
        ...user,
        address: {
          ...user.address,
          country: "Germany",
        },
      });
      ```

      This approach is bit verbose and not easy for deep hierarchical state updates. But this workaround can be used for few levels of nested objects without much hassle.

258.  ### How do you update arrays inside state?

      Eventhough arrays in JavaScript are mutable in nature, you need to treat them as immutable while storing them in a state. That means, similar to objects, the arrays cannot be updated directly inside state. Instead, you need to create a copy of the existing array and then set the state to use newly copied array.

      To ensure that arrays are not mutated, the mutation operations like direct direct assignment(arr[1]='one'), push, pop, shift, unshift, splice etc methods should be avoided on original array. Instead, you can create a copy of existing array with help of array operations such as filter, map, slice, spread syntax etc.

      For example, the below push operation doesn't add the new todo to the total todo's list in an event handler.

      ```jsx
      onClick = {
        todos.push({
          id: id+1,
          name: name
        })
      }
      ```

      This issue is fixed by replacing push operation with spread syntax where it will create a new array and the UI updated with new todo.

      ```jsx
      onClick = {
        [
          ...todos,
          { id: id+1, name: name }
        ]
      }
      ```

259.  ### How do you use immer library for state updates?

      Immer library enforces the immutability of state based on **copy-on-write** mechanism. It uses JavaScript proxy to keep track of updates to immutable states. Immer has 3 main states as below,

      1. **Current state:** It refers to actual state
      2. **Draft state:** All new changes will be applied to this state. In this state, draft is just a proxy of the current state.
      3. **Next state:** It is formed after all mutations applied to the draft state

      Immer can be used by following below instructions,

      1. Install the dependency using `npm install use-immer` command
      2. Replace `useState` hook with `useImmer` hook by importing at the top
      3. The setter function of `useImmer` hook can be used to update the state.

      For example, the mutation syntax of immer library simplifies the nested address object of user state as follows,

      ```jsx
      import { useImmer } from "use-immer";
      const [user, setUser] = useImmer({
        name: "John",
        age: 32,
        address: {
          country: "Singapore",
          postalCode: 440004,
        },
      });

      //Update user details upon any event
      setUser((draft) => {
        draft.address.country = "Germany";
      });
      ```

      The preceding code enables you to update nested objects with a conceise mutation syntax.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

261.  ### What are the preferred and non-preferred array operations for updating the state?

      The below table represent preferred and non-preferred array operations for updating the component state.

      | Action    | Preferred            | Non-preferred              |
      | --------- | -------------------- | -------------------------- |
      | Adding    | concat, [...arr]     | push, unshift              |
      | Removing  | filter, slice        | pop, shift, splice         |
      | Replacing | map                  | splice, arr[i] = someValue |
      | sorting   | copying to new array | reverse, sort              |

      If you use Immer library then you can able to use all array methods without any problem.

263. ### Can I use keys for non-list items?

     Keys are primarily used for rendering list items but they are not just for list items. You can also use them React to distinguish components. By default, React uses order of the components in

264. ### What are the guidelines to be followed for writing reducers?

     There are two guidelines to be taken care while writing reducers in your code.

     1. Reducers must be pure without mutating the state. That means, same input always returns the same output. These reducers run during rendering time similar to state updater functions. So these functions should not send any requests, schedule time outs and any other side effects.

     2. Each action should describe a single user interaction even though there are multiple changes applied to data. For example, if you "reset" registration form which has many user input fields managed by a reducer, it is suggested to send one "reset" action instead of creating separate action for each fields. The proper ordering of actions should reflect the user interactions in the browser and it helps a lot for debugging purpose.

265. ### How does ReactJS work behind the scenes?
     ReactJS is a powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces. While it appears simple on the surface, React performs a lot of complex operations behind the scenes to efficiently update the UI. Here's an overview of how it works internally:

     #### **1. Virtual DOM & Component Rendering**

     React doesn't manipulate the real DOM directly. Instead, it uses a **Virtual DOM** — a lightweight JavaScript representation of the UI.

     When a component renders (e.g., `<App />`):

        *   React **executes the component function** (e.g., `App()`).
        *   Hooks like `useState` are registered and tracked in order.
        *   React builds a **Virtual DOM tree** from the returned JSX.
        *   This virtual DOM is a **plain JS object** that describes the desired UI.

     This process ensures fast and efficient rendering before React decides how to update the real DOM.

     #### 2. **React Fiber Architecture**

     React’s core engine is called **Fiber**, introduced in React 16. Fiber is a reimplementation of the React reconciliation algorithm with the following capabilities:

        *   Breaks rendering work into **units of work** (fiber nodes).
        *   Enables **interruptible rendering** (important for responsiveness).
        *   Supports **priority scheduling** and **concurrent rendering**.

     Each Fiber node represents a component and stores:

        *   The component type (function/class).
        *   Props, state, and effects.
        *   Links to parent, child, and sibling fibers.

     #### 3. **Reconciliation (Diffing Algorithm)**

     When state or props change:

        *   React re-executes the component to produce a new virtual DOM.
        *   It **compares the new virtual DOM to the previous one** using an efficient diffing algorithm.
        *   React determines the **minimal set of DOM changes** required.

     This process is known as **reconciliation**.

     #### 4. **Commit Phase (Real DOM Updates)**

     Once reconciliation is done:

        *   React enters the **commit phase**.
        *   It applies calculated changes to the **real DOM**.
        *   It also runs side effects like `useEffect` or `useLayoutEffect`.

     This is the only time React interacts directly with the browser DOM.

     #### 5. **Hooks and State Management**

     With Hooks (like `useState`, `useEffect`):

        *   React keeps an **internal list of hooks per component**.
        *   Hooks are identified by their order in the function.
        *   When state updates occur, React re-renders the component and re-runs the hooks in the same order.

     #### 6. **React Scheduler**

     React uses an internal **Scheduler** to control how updates are prioritized:

        *   Urgent tasks like clicks and inputs are processed immediately.
        *   Non-urgent tasks (like data fetching) can be delayed or paused.
        *   This improves responsiveness and allows for **time slicing** in Concurrent Mode.

266. ### How is `useReducer` Different from `useState`?
     There are notable differences between `useState` and `useReducer` hooks.
           
        | Feature               | `useState`                           | `useReducer`                          |
        |-----------------------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
        | State complexity      | Simple (one variable or flat object) | Complex, multi-part or deeply nested  |
        | Update style          | Direct (e.g. `setState(x)`)          | Through actions (e.g. `dispatch({})`) |
        | Update logic          | In component                         | In reducer function                   |
        | Reusability & testing | Less reusable                        | Highly reusable & testable            |

267. ### What is useContext? What are the steps to follow for useContext?
     The `useContext` hook is a built-in React Hook that lets you access the value of a context inside a functional component without needing to wrap it in a <Context.Consumer> component.

     It helps you **avoid prop drilling** (passing props through multiple levels) by allowing components to access shared data like themes, authentication status, or user preferences.

     The usage of useContext involves three main steps:
      #### **Step 1 : Create the Context**
    
        Use `React.createContext()` to create a context object.
    
        ```jsx
        import React, { createContext } from 'react'; 
    
        const ThemeContext = createContext(); // default value optional
        ```
    
      You typically export this so other components can import it.

      #### **Step 2: Provide the Context Value**
    
        Wrap your component tree (or a part of it) with the `Context.Provider` and pass a `value` prop.
    
        ```jsx
        function App() {
            return ( 
                <ThemeContext.Provider value="dark">
                   <MyComponent />
                </ThemeContext.Provider>
            ); 
        }
        ```
    
        Now any component inside `<ThemeContext.Provider>` can access the context value.

        #### **Step 3: Consume the Context with** `**useContext**`
    
        In any functional component **inside the Provider**, use the `useContext` hook:
    
        ```jsx
        import { useContext } from 'react'; 
        function MyComponent() {
            const theme = useContext(ThemeContext); // theme = "dark"
            return <p>Current Theme: {theme}</p>; 
        }
        ```

268. ### What are the use cases of useContext hook?
     The `useContext` hook in React is used to share data across components without having to pass props manually through each level. Here are some common and effective use cases:

        1.  **Theme Customization**  
            `useContext` can be used to manage application-wide themes, such as light and dark modes, ensuring consistent styling and enabling user-driven customization.
        2.  **Localization and Internationalization**  
            It supports localization by providing translated strings or locale-specific content to components, adapting the application for users in different regions.
        3.  **User Authentication and Session Management**  
            `useContext` allows global access to authentication status and user data. This enables conditional rendering of components and helps manage protected routes or user-specific UI elements.
        4.  **Shared Modal or Sidebar Visibility**  
            It's ideal for managing the visibility of shared UI components like modals, drawers, or sidebars, especially when their state needs to be controlled from various parts of the app.
        5.  **Combining with** `**useReducer**` **for Global State Management**  
            When combined with `useReducer`, `useContext` becomes a powerful tool for managing more complex global state logic. This pattern helps maintain cleaner, scalable state logic without introducing external libraries like Redux.
             Some of the common use cases of useContext are listed below,

269.  ### When to use client and server components?

      You can efficiently build nextjs application if you are aware about which part of the application needs to use client components and which other parts needs to use server components. The common cases of both client and server components are listed below:

        **Client components:**
        1. Whenever your need to add interactivity and event listeners such as onClick(), onChange(), etc to the pages
        2. If you need to use State and Lifecycle Effects like useState(), useReducer(), useEffect() etc.
        3. If there is a requirement to use browser-only APIs.
        4. If you need to implement custom hooks that depend on state, effects, or browser-only APIs.
        5. There are React Class components in the pages.

        **Server components:**
        1. If the component logic is about data fetching.
        2. If you need to access backend resources directly.
        3. When you need to keep sensitive information((access tokens, API keys, etc)	) on the server.
        4. If you want reduce client-side JavaScript and placing large dependencies on the server.

270. ### What are the differences between page router and app router in nextjs?

     Next.js provides two different routing systems: the **Page Router** (traditional) and the **App Router** (introduced in Next.js 13). The App Router is built on React Server Components and offers more powerful features for modern web applications.

     Here are the main differences between them:

     | Feature | Page Router | App Router |
     |---------|-------------|------------|
     | Directory | Uses `pages/` directory | Uses `app/` directory |
     | Routing | File-based routing with files like `pages/about.js` | File-based routing with folders and special files like `app/about/page.js` |
     | Components | All components are Client Components by default | All components are Server Components by default |
     | Layouts | Custom `_app.js` and `_document.js` for shared layouts | Native nested layouts using `layout.js` files |
     | Data Fetching | Uses `getServerSideProps`, `getStaticProps`, and `getInitialProps` | Uses `async/await` in Server Components with native `fetch` |
     | Loading States | Manual implementation required | Built-in `loading.js` for streaming and suspense |
     | Error Handling | Custom `_error.js` page | Built-in `error.js` for error boundaries at any level |
     | Streaming | Limited support | Built-in support for streaming with Suspense |
     | Server Actions | Not available | Native support for server-side mutations |
     | Metadata | Using `Head` component from `next/head` | Native Metadata API with `metadata` object or `generateMetadata` function |
     | Rendering | SSR, SSG, ISR, and CSR | SSR, SSG, ISR, CSR plus React Server Components |

     **Example of Page Router structure:**
     ```
     pages/
     ├── index.js          // Home page (/)
     ├── about.js          // About page (/about)
     ├── _app.js           // Custom App component
     ├── _document.js      // Custom Document
     └── posts/
         └── [id].js       // Dynamic route (/posts/:id)
     ```

     **Example of App Router structure:**
     ```
     app/
     ├── page.js           // Home page (/)
     ├── layout.js         // Root layout
     ├── loading.js        // Loading UI
     ├── error.js          // Error UI
     ├── about/
     │   └── page.js       // About page (/about)
     └── posts/
         └── [id]/
             └── page.js   // Dynamic route (/posts/:id)
     ```

     **Note:** The App Router is recommended for new Next.js applications as it provides better performance, simpler data fetching patterns, and improved developer experience with React Server Components.

271. ### Can you describe the useMemo() Hook?

     The `useMemo()` Hook in React is used to **optimize performance** by **memoizing the result of expensive calculations**. It ensures that a function is **only re-executed when its dependencies change**, preventing unnecessary computations on every re-render.

     #### Syntax

     ```js
      const memoizedValue = useMemo(() => computeExpensiveValue(arg), [dependencies]);
     ```
      - **`computeExpensiveValue`**:  
      A function that returns the computed result.

     - **`dependencies`**:  
      An array of values that, when changed, will cause the memoized function to re-run.

      If the dependencies haven’t changed since the last render, React returns the **cached result** instead of re-running the function.

      Let's exaplain the usage of `useMemo` hook with an example of user search and its respective filtered users list.

      #### Example: Memoizing a Filtered List
      ```javascript
      import React, { useState, useMemo } from 'react';

      const users = [
        { id: 1, name: 'Sudheer' },
        { id: 2, name: 'Brendon' },
        { id: 3, name: 'Charlie' },
        { id: 4, name: 'Dary' },
        { id: 5, name: 'Eden' }
      ];

      export default function UserSearch({ users }) {
        const [searchTerm, setSearchTerm] = useState('');
        const [counter, setCounter] = useState(0);

        // Memoize the filtered user list based on the search term
        const filteredUsers = useMemo(() => {
          console.log("Filtering users...");
          return users.filter(user =>
            user.name.toLowerCase().includes(searchTerm.toLowerCase())
          );
        }, [searchTerm]);

        return (
          <div>
            <h2>Counter: {counter}</h2>
            <button onClick={() => setCounter(prev => prev + 1)}>Increment Counter</button>

            <h2>Search Users</h2>
            <input
              type="text"
              value={searchTerm}
              onChange={(e) => setSearchTerm(e.target.value)}
              placeholder="Enter name"
            />

            <ul>
              {filteredUsers.map(user => (
                <li key={user.id}>{user.name}</li>
              ))}
            </ul>
          </div>
        );
      }
      ```

      In the above example:
        - The filteredUsers list is only recomputed when searchTerm changes.
        - Pressing the "Increment Counter" button does not trigger the filtering logic again, as it's not a dependency.
        - The console will only log "Filtering users..." when the search term updates.

272. ### Can Hooks be used in class components?
     No, Hooks cannot be used inside class components. They are specially designed for function components. This is because hooks depend on the sequence in which they are called during a component’s render, something that's only guaranteed in functional components. However, both class and function components can coexist in the same application.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

273. ### What is an updater function? Should an updater function be used in all cases?
     An **updater function** is a form of `setState` where you pass a **function** instead of a direct value. This function receives the **previous state** as an argument and returns the **next state**.
     
     The updater function expression looks like below,
     ```js
     setCount(prevCount => prevCount + 1); // Safe and predictable
     ```
     Here, `prevCount => prevCount + 1` is the updater function.

     In the React community, there's often a recommendation to use updater functions when updating state that depends on its previous value. This helps prevent unexpected behaviors that can arise from working with outdated or "stale" state.

     While using an updater function is a good habit, it's not always necessary. In most cases, React batches updates and ensures that the state is up-to-date at the beginning of the event handler, so you typically don’t run into stale state issues during a single synchronous event.
     However, if you’re doing multiple updates to the same state variable within a single handler, using the updater form ensures that each update correctly uses the latest state value, rather than a potentially outdated one.

     **Example: Multiple Updates in One Handler**
     ```js
     function handleCount() {
        setCounter(a => a + 1);
        setCounter(a => a + 1);
        setCounter(a => a + 1);
     }
     ```

     In this example, `a => a + 1` is an **updater function**. React queues these updater functions and applies them sequentially, each using the most recent state value. As a result, the counter will correctly increment by 3.

     In many cases, such as setting state based on user input or assigning static values, you don’t need the updater function:
     ```js
     setName('Sudheer');
     ```
     
**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

274. ### Can useState take a function as an initial value?
     Yes, `useState` can take a function as an initial value, and this is a useful feature in React called **lazy initialization**. This function is also known as **initializer function**.

     When you call useState(initialValue), you normally pass in a value directly:
     
     ```js
     const [count, setCount] = useState(0);  // initial value is 0
     ```

     But if calculating that initial value is expensive or involves logic, you can pass a function that returns the value:
     ```js
        const [count, setCount] = useState(() => {
        // This function only runs once — when the component first renders
        return expensiveComputation();
        });
     ```
     
     This function avoids doing heavy computation on every render. If you don't use this function form and invokes it directly, the function will run everytime the component renders and impact the performance.
     For example, the below usage is not recommended. 
     ```js
     const [count, setCount] = useState(expensiveComputation());
     ```

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

275. ### What types of values can `useState` hold?

     The `useState` hook accepts different types of values.

     *   Primitives: `number`, `string`, `boolean`
     *   Arrays
     *   Objects
     *   Functions
     *   `null` or `undefined`

     But you needs to be cautious with **reference types (objects/arrays)** because React compares old and new values **by reference**, so direct mutations won't trigger a re-render.
     For example, the correct and wrong ways of state updates as shown below, 
     ```js
     user.name = "Sudheer"; //wrong way
     setUser(prev => ({ ...prev, name: 'Sudheer' })); //correct way
     ```
**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

276. ### What happens if you call `useState` conditionally?
     As per rules of React Hooks, hooks must be called unconditionally. For example, if you conditionally call it:
     ```js
     if (someCondition) { 
        const [state, setState] = useState(0); 
     }
     ```

     React will throw a runtime error because it **relies on the order of Hook calls**, and conditional logic breaks that order.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

277. ### Is useState Synchronous or Asynchronous?
     The `useState` hook is synchronous, but state updates are asynchronous. When you call `useState()`, it runs synchronously and returns the state variable and setter function as tuple.
     ```js
     const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
     ```
     This happens immediately during rendering.
     However, the state update function (**setState**) is asynchronous in the sense that it doesn't update the state immediately.
     React **batches** updates and applies them before the next render. You won’t see the updated value immediately after calling `setState`.
     
     **Example:**
     ```js
     const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
    
     function handleClick() {
       setCount(count + 1);
       console.log(count); // ❗️Still logs the old value
     }
     ```
     The > `console.log(count)` prints the **old value**, because the update hasn’t happened yet.
     
     To see the updated state value, you can use `useEffect()` hook. It runs **after the component has re-rendered.**  By the time `useEffect` runs:

        *   The component has been updated.
        *   The **state contains the new value**.
     
        ```js
        import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

        function Counter() {
        const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
        
        const handleClick = () => {
        setCount(count + 1);
        console.log('Clicked count (old):', count); // Old value
        };
        
        useEffect(() => {
        console.log('Updated count:', count); // New value
        }, [count]); // Only runs when `count` changes
        
        return <button onClick={handleClick}>Count: {count}</button>;
        }
        ```

278.  ### Can you explain how useState works internally?
      React’s hooks, including `useState`, rely on some internal machinery that keeps track of state **per component** and **per hook call** during rendering. Here's a simplified explanation of the internal mechanics:

      #### 1. **Hook List / Linked List**

      *   React maintains a linked list or array of "hook states" for each component.
      *   When a component renders, React keeps track of which hook it is currently processing via a cursor/index.
      *   Each call to `useState()` corresponds to one "slot" in this list.

      #### 2. **State Storage**

      *   Each slot stores:
        *   The current state value.
        *   A queue of pending state updates.

      #### 3. **Initial Render**
        
      *   When the component first renders, React:
         *   Creates a new slot for `useState` with the initial state (e.g., `0`).
         *   Returns `[state, updaterFunction]`.

      #### 4. **Updater Function**
    
      *   The updater function (`setCount`) is a closure that, when called:
        *   Enqueues a state update to React's internal queue.
        *   Schedules a re-render of the component.
    
      #### 5. **Re-render and State Update**
    
      *   On the next render:
        *   React processes all queued updates for each hook slot.
        *   Updates the stored state value accordingly.
        *   Returns the new state to the component.

      #### 6. **Important: Hook Order**

      *   Hooks must be called in the same order on every render so React can match hook calls to their internal slots.
      *   That’s why you can’t call hooks conditionally.
      
      The pseudocode for internal implementation of `useState` looks like below,
      ```js
        let hookIndex = 0;
        const hooks = [];
        
        function useState(initialValue) {
            const currentIndex = hookIndex;
        
            if (!hooks[currentIndex]) {
                // First render: initialize state
                hooks[currentIndex] = {
                    state: initialValue,
                    queue: [],
                };
            }
        
            const hook = hooks[currentIndex];
        
            // Process queued updates
            hook.queue.forEach(update => {
                hook.state = update(hook.state);
            });
            hook.queue = [];
        
            // Define updater function
            function setState(action) {
                // action can be new state or function(state) => new state
                hook.queue.push(typeof action === 'function' ? action : () => action);
                scheduleRender(); // triggers React re-render
            }
        
            hookIndex++;
            return [hook.state, setState];
        }
        ```

279. ### What is `useReducer`? Why do you use useReducer?
     The `useReducer` hook is a React hook used to manage **complex state logic** inside **functional components**. It is conceptually similar to **Redux**. i.e, Instead of directly updating state like with `useState`, you **dispatch an action** to a **reducer function**, and the reducer returns the new state.

     The `useReducer` hook takes three arguments:

        ```js
        const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState, initFunction);
        ```

        *   `**reducer**`: A function `(state, action) => newState` that handles how state should change based on the action.
        *   `**initialState**`: The starting state.
        *   `**dispatch**`: A function you call to trigger an update by passing an action.

     The `useReducer` hook is used when:

     *   The **state is complex**, such as nested structures or multiple related values.
     *   State updates depend on the **previous state** and **logic**.
     *   You want to **separate state update logic** from UI code to make it cleaner and testable.
     *   You’re managing features like:
         *   Forms
         *   Wizards / Multi-step flows
         *   Undo/Redo functionality
         *   Shopping cart logic
         *   Toggle & conditional UI logic

     The `useReducer` hooks works similarly to Redux, where:

        *   You define a **reducer function** to handle state transitions.
        *   You dispatch actions to update the state.
     
     **Counter Example with Increment, Decrement, and Reset:**
     1. Reducer function:

        Define a counter reducer function that takes the current state and an action object with a type, and returns a new state based on that type.
     
         ```js
         function counterReducer(state, action) {
            switch (action.type) {
              case 'increment':
                return { count: state.count + 1 };
              case 'decrement':
                return { count: state.count - 1 };
              case 'reset':
                return { count: 0 };
              default:
                return state;
            }
          }
         ```
     2. Using `useReducer`:
      Invoke `useReducer` with above reducer function along with initial state. Thereafter, you can attach dispatch actions for respective button handlers.
      ```js
      import React, { useReducer } from 'react';

        function Counter() {
          const initialState = { count: 0 };
          const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(counterReducer, initialState);

          return (
            <div style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>
              <h2>Count: {state.count}</h2>
              <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: 'increment' })}>Increment</button>
              <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: 'decrement' })}>Decrement</button>
              <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: 'reset' })}>Reset</button>
            </div>
          );
        }

      export default Counter;
      ```
      Once the new state has been returned, React re-renders the component with the updated `state.count`.

281. ### Can you combine **useReducer** with **useContext**?

      Yes, it's common to combine **useReducer** with **useContext** to build a lightweight state management system similar to Redux:

      ```js
      const AppContext = React.createContext();

      function AppProvider({ children }) {
        const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);
        return (
          <AppContext.Provider value={{ state, dispatch }}>
            {children}
          </AppContext.Provider>
        );
      }
      ```

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

282. ### Can you dispatch multiple actions in a row with useReducer?
     Yes, you can dispatch multiple actions in a row using `useReducer` but not directly in one call. You'd have to call dispatch multiple times or create a composite action in your reducer that performs multiple updates based on the action type.
     
     **Example: Dispatching Multiple Actions**
     You can define a custom function with dispatching actions one by one.
     ```js
     function handleMultipleActions(dispatch) {
       dispatch({ type: 'increment' });
       dispatch({ type: 'increment' });
       dispatch({ type: 'reset' });
     }
     ```
     After that, you need to invoke it through event handler
     ```js
     <button onClick={() => handleMultipleActions(dispatch)}>
       Run Multiple Actions
     </button>
     ```
     **Note:** You can also define a custom action type If you want multiple state changes to be handled in one reducer call.
     ```js
     case 'increment_twice':
       return { count: state.count + 2 };
     ```
     Then dispatch
     ```js
     dispatch({ type: 'increment_twice' });
     ```

283. ### How does useContext works? Explain with an example
     The `useContext` hook can be used for authentication state management across multiple components and pages in a React application.
    
     Let's build a simple authentication flow with:

        *   **Login and Logout buttons**
        *   Global `AuthContext` to share state
        *   Components that can **access and update** auth status
     
      **1. Create the Auth Context:**

       You can define `AuthProvider` which holds and provides `user`, `login()`, and `logout()` via context.
        ```js
        // AuthContext.js
        import React, { createContext, useContext, useState } from 'react';
        
        const AuthContext = createContext();
        
        export function AuthProvider({ children }) {
          const [user, setUser] = useState(null);
        
          const login = (username) => setUser({ name: username });
          const logout = () => setUser(null);
        
          return (
            <AuthContext.Provider value={{ user, login, logout }}>
              {children}
            </AuthContext.Provider>
          );
        }
        
        // Custom hook for cleaner usage
        export const useAuth = () => useContext(AuthContext);
        ```
     **2. Wrap Your App with the Provider:**
       
        Wrap the above created provider in main `App.js` file      
        ```js
        // App.js
        import React from 'react';
        import { AuthProvider } from './AuthContext';
        import HomePage from './HomePage';
        import Dashboard from './Dashboard';
        
        function App() {
          return (
            <AuthProvider>
              <HomePage />
              <Dashboard />
            </AuthProvider>
          );
        }
        
        export default App;
        ```
     **3. Home page with login:**
      Read or access user and login details through custom useAuth hook and use it inside home page.

        ```js
         // HomePage.js
         import React from 'react';
         import { useAuth } from './AuthContext';
    
         function HomePage() {
           const { user, login } = useAuth();
    
           return (
             <div>
               <h1>Home</h1>
               {user ? (
                 <p>Welcome back, {user.name}!</p>
               ) : (
                 <button onClick={() => login('Alice')}>Login</button>
               )}
             </div>
           );
         }
    
         export default HomePage;
        ```
     
     **4. Dashboard with logout:**
      Read or access user and logout details from `useAuth` custom hook and use it inside dashboard page.

      ```js
        // Dashboard.js
        import React from 'react';
        import { useAuth } from './AuthContext';
        
        function Dashboard() {
          const { user, logout } = useAuth();
        
          if (!user) {
            return <p>Please login to view the dashboard.</p>;
          }
        
          return (
            <div>
              <h2>Dashboard</h2>
              <p>Logged in as: {user.name}</p>
              <button onClick={logout}>Logout</button>
            </div>
          );
        }
        
        export default Dashboard;
      ```

284. ### Can You Use Multiple Contexts in One Component?
     Yes, it is possible. You can use multiple contexts inside the same component by calling useContext multiple times, once for each context.

     It can be achieved with below steps,

        *   Create multiple contexts using `createContext()`.
        *   Wrap your component tree with multiple `<Provider>`s.
        *   Call `useContext()` separately for each context in the same component.
     
     **Example: Using `ThemeContext` and `UserContext` Together**
     ```js
     import React, { createContext, useContext } from 'react';

      // Step 1: Create two contexts
      const ThemeContext = createContext();
      const UserContext = createContext();

      function Dashboard() {
        // Step 2: Use both contexts
        const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);
        const user = useContext(UserContext);

        return (
          <div style={{ background: theme === 'dark' ? '#333' : '#fff' }}>
            <h1>Welcome, {user.name}</h1>
            <p>Current theme: {theme}</p>
          </div>
        );
      }

      // Step 3: Provide both contexts
      function App() {
        return (
          <ThemeContext.Provider value="dark">
            <UserContext.Provider value={{ name: 'Sudheer' }}>
              <Dashboard />
            </UserContext.Provider>
          </ThemeContext.Provider>
        );
      }

      export default App;
     ```

285. ###  What's a common pitfall when using useContext with objects?
     A **common pitfall** when using `useContext` with objects is **triggering unnecessary re-renders** across all consuming components — even when only part of the context value changes.

     When you provide an object as the context value, React compares the entire object reference. If the object changes (even slightly), React assumes the whole context has changed, and **all components using** `useContext(MyContext)` **will re-render**, regardless of whether they use the part that changed.

     **Example:**
     ```js
        const MyContext = React.createContext();

        function MyProvider({ children }) {
          const [user, setUser] = useState(null);
          const [theme, setTheme] = useState('light');

          // This causes all consumers to re-render on any state change
          const contextValue = { user, setUser, theme, setTheme };

          return (
            <MyContext.Provider value={contextValue}>
              {children}
            </MyContext.Provider>
          );
        }
     ```
     In this case, a change in `theme` will also trigger a re-render in components that only care about `user`.

     This issue can be fixed in two ways,

     **1. Split Contexts**  
     Create separate contexts for unrelated pieces of state:

     ```jsx
     const UserContext = React.createContext(); 
     const ThemeContext = React.createContext();
     ```

     **2. Memoize Context Value**  
     Use `useMemo` to prevent unnecessary re-renders:

     ```jsx
       const contextValue = useMemo(() => ({ user, setUser, theme, setTheme }), [user, theme]);
     ```

     However, this only helps if the object structure and dependencies are well controlled.
    
  **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

286. ### What would the context value be for no matching provider?
    
     When a component calls `useContext(SomeContext)` but **no matching** `<SomeContext.Provider>` **is present higher up in the component tree**, the **default value** passed to `React.createContext(defaultValue)` is returned.
    
     ```js
     const ThemeContext = React.createContext('light'); // 'light' is the default value
    
     function ThemedComponent() {
       const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);
       return <div>Current theme: {theme}</div>;
     }
    
     // No ThemeContext.Provider anywhere in the tree
     ```
     In this case, `theme` will be 'light'. It's the default value you provided when you created the context.
    
     **Note:** If you don’t specify a default value, the context value will be undefined when used without a provider:
    
     ```jsx
     const AuthContext = React.createContext(); // No default
    
     function Profile() {
       const auth = useContext(AuthContext);
       // auth will be undefined if there's no AuthContext.Provider
     }
     ```

287. ### How do reactive dependencies in the useEffect dependency array affect its execution behavior?
     The `useEffect` hook accepts an optional dependencies argument that accepts an array of reactive values. The **dependency array** determines **when** the effect runs. i.e, It makes `useEffect` _reactive_ to changes in specified values.

     #### **How Dependency Array Affects Behavior**

     1. **Empty Dependency Array:** `**[]**`

     ```css
     useEffect(() => {
       // runs once after the initial render
     }, []);
     ```

      *   Effect runs **only once** (like `componentDidMount`).
      *   Ignores all state/prop changes.

     2. **With Specific Dependencies:** `**[count, user]**`

     ```css
     useEffect(() => {
       // runs after initial render
       // AND whenever `count` or `user` changes
     }, [count, user]);
     ```

       *   Effect runs on **first render**, and
       *   Again **every time** any dependency value changes.

     3. **No Dependency Array (Omitted)**

          ```css
          useEffect(() => {
            // runs after **every** render
          });
          ```

           *   Effect runs after **every render**, regardless of what changed.
           *   Can lead to **performance issues** if not used carefully.

       React uses shallow comparison of the dependencies. If any value has changed (!==), the effect will re-run.
       
       **Note:** This hook works well when dependencies are primitives or memoized objects/functions.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

288. ### When and how often does React invoke the setup and cleanup functions inside a useEffect hook?

     1. **Setup Function Execution (`useEffect`)**

         The setup function (or the main function) you pass to `useEffect` runs at specific points:

           1.  **After the component is mounted** (if the dependency array is empty `[]`)
           2.  **After every render** (if no dependency array is provided)
           3.  **After a dependency value changes** (if the dependency array contains variables)

     2. **Cleanup Function Execution (Returned function from `useEffect`)**

        The cleanup function is called **before the effect is re-executed** and when the component **unmounts**.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

289. ### What happens if you return a Promise from useEffect??
      You should NOT return a Promise from useEffect. React expects the function passed to useEffect to return either nothing (undefined) or a cleanup function (synchronous function). i.e, It does not expect or handle a returned Promise. If you still return a Promise, React will ignore it silently, and it may lead to bugs or warnings in strict mode.

      **Incorrect:**
      ```js
      useEffect(async () => {
        await fetchData(); // ❌ useEffect shouldn't be async
      }, []);
      ```
      **Correct:**
      ```jsx
      useEffect(() => {
        const fetchData = async () => {
          const res = await fetch('/api');
          const data = await res.json();
          setData(data);
        };

        fetchData();
      }, []);
      ```
**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

289. ### Can you have multiple useEffect hooks in a single component?
      Yes, multiple useEffect hooks are allowed and recommended when you want to separate concerns.

      ```jsx
      useEffect(() => {
        // Handles API fetch
      }, []);

      useEffect(() => {
        // Handles event listeners
      }, []);
      ```
      Each effect runs independently and helps make code modular and easier to debug.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

290. ### How to prevent infinite loops with useEffect?
        Infinite loops happen when the effect updates state that’s listed in its own dependency array, which causes the effect to re-run, updating state again and so on.
        
        **Infinite loop scenario:**
        ```js
        useEffect(() => {
          setCount(count + 1);
        }, [count]); // Triggers again every time count updates
        ```
        You need to ensure that setState calls do not depend on values that cause the effect to rerun, or isolate them with a guard.
        ```js
        useEffect(() => {
          if (count < 5) {
            setCount(count + 1);
          }
        }, [count]);
        ```
**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

291. ### What are the usecases of useLayoutEffect?
      You need to use `useLayoutEffect` when your effect **must run before the browser paints**, such as:

      *   **Reading layout measurements** (e.g., element size, scroll position)
      *   **Synchronously applying DOM styles** to prevent visual flicker
      *   **Animating layout or transitions**
      *   **Integrating with third-party libraries** that require DOM manipulation

      If there's no visual or layout dependency, prefer `useEffect` — it's more performance-friendly.

      ```js
      useLayoutEffect(() => {
        const width = divRef.current.offsetWidth;
        if (width < 400) {
          divRef.current.style.background = 'blue'; // prevents flicker
        }
      }, []);
      ```

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

292. ### How does useLayoutEffect work during server-side rendering (SSR)?

     The `useLayoutEffect` hook does **not run on the server**, because there is no DOM. React issues a warning in server environments like Next.js if `useLayoutEffect` is used directly.

     This can be mitigated using a conditional polyfill:

      ```jsx
      const useIsomorphicLayoutEffect =
        typeof window !== 'undefined' ? useLayoutEffect : useEffect;
      ```

      i.e, Use `useIsomorphicLayoutEffect` in components that render both on client and server.     

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)** 

293. ### What happens if you use useLayoutEffect for non-layout logic?
      Using `useLayoutEffect` for logic **unrelated to layout or visual DOM changes** (such as logging, data fetching, or analytics) is **not recommended**. It can lead to **performance issues** or even unexpected behavior.

      **Example: Anti-pattern**
      ```js
      useLayoutEffect(() => {
        console.log("Tracking analytics");
        fetch('/log-page-view');
      }, []);
      ```
      The above usage delays the paint of the UI just to send a network request, which could (and should) be done after paint using useEffect.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)** 

294. ### How does useLayoutEffect cause layout thrashing?
      The `useLayoutEffect` can **cause layout thrashing** when you **repeatedly read and write to the DOM** in ways that force the browser to recalculate layout multiple times per frame. This is because `useLayoutEffect` runs _before the browser paints_, these reflows happen _synchronously_, blocking rendering and degrading performance.

      **Example:**
      ```js
      function ThrashingComponent() {
        const ref = useRef();

        useLayoutEffect(() => {
          const height = ref.current.offsetHeight; //Read
          ref.current.style.height = height + 20 + 'px'; //Write
          const newHeight = ref.current.offsetHeight; //Read again — forces reflow
        }, []);

        return <div ref={ref}>Hello</div>;
      }
      ```
      In the above code, each read/write cycle triggers synchronous reflows, blocking the main thread and delays UI rendering.

      This issue can be avoided by batching your DOM reads and writes and prevent unnecessary reads after writes.

295. ### How Do You Use useRef to Access a DOM Element in React? Give an example.
        The `useRef` hook is commonly used in React to directly reference and interact with DOM elements — like focusing an input, scrolling to a section, or controlling media elements.
        
        When you assign a ref to a DOM element using useRef, React gives you access to the underlying DOM node via the .current property of the ref object.
        
        **Example: Focus an input**

        ```js
        import React, { useRef } from 'react';
        
        function FocusInput() {
          const inputRef = useRef(null); // create the ref
        
          const handleFocus = () => {
            inputRef.current.focus(); // access DOM element and focus it
          };
        
          return (
            <div>
              <input type="text" ref={inputRef} />
              <button onClick={handleFocus}>Focus the input</button>
            </div>
          );
        }
        ```
       **Note:** The DOM reference is only available **after the component has mounted** — typically accessed in `useEffect` or event handlers.

296. ### Can you use useRef to persist values across renders??
        Yes, you can use `useRef` to persist values across renders in React. Unlike `useState`, changing `.current` does not cause re-renders, but the value is preserved across renders.
        
        **Example:**
        ```js
        function Timer() {
          const renderCount = useRef(0);
          useEffect(() => {
            renderCount.current++;
            console.log("Render count:", renderCount.current);
          });
        
          return <div>Check console for render count.</div>;
        }
        ```
**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

297. ###  Can useRef be used to store previous values?
        Yes, `useRef` is a common pattern when you want to compare current and previous props or state without causing re-renders.
        
        **Example: Storing previous state value**
        ```js
        import { useEffect, useRef, useState } from 'react';
        
        function PreviousValueExample() {
          const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
          const prevCountRef = useRef();
        
          useEffect(() => {
            prevCountRef.current = count;
          }, [count]);
        
          const prevCount = prevCountRef.current;
        
          return (
            <div>
              <p>Current: {count}</p>
              <p>Previous: {prevCount}</p>
              <button onClick={() => setCount(c => c + 1)}>Increment</button>
            </div>
          );
        }
        ```

298. ### Is it possible to access a ref in the render method?
        Yes, you can access a ref in the render method, but what you get from it depends on how you're using the ref and when in the component lifecycle you're rendering.
        
        For example, when using ref to access a DOM node (e.g., divRef.current), it's not immediately available on the first render.
        ```js
        const divRef = useRef(null);
        
        console.log(divRef.current); // ❌ null on initial render
        return <div ref={divRef}>Hello</div>;
        ```
     
**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

299. ### What are the common usecases of useRef hook?
      Some of the common cases are:
      *   Automatically focus an input when a component mounts.
      *   Scroll to a specific element.
      *   Measure element dimensions (`offsetWidth`, `clientHeight`).
      *   Control video/audio playback.
      *   Integrate with non-React libraries (like D3 or jQuery).

300. ### What is useImperativeHandle Hook? Give an example.
      `useImperativeHandle` is a React Hook that allows a **child component** to expose **custom functions or properties** to its **parent component**, when using `ref`.
      It is typically used with `forwardRef` and is very useful in cases like **modals**, **dialogs**, **custom inputs**, etc., where the parent needs to **control behavior imperatively** (e.g., open, close, reset).

      **Example: Dialog component**
      ```js
      import React, {
        useRef,
        useState,
        useImperativeHandle,
        forwardRef,
      } from 'react';
      import './Dialog.css'; 

      const Dialog = forwardRef((props, ref) => {
        const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = useState(false);
        const [formData, setFormData] = useState('');

        useImperativeHandle(ref, () => ({
          open: () => setIsOpen(true),
          close: () => setIsOpen(false),
          reset: () => setFormData(''),
        }));

        if (!isOpen) return null;

        return (
          <div className="dialog"> 
            <h2>Dialog</h2>
            <input
              type="text"
              value={formData}
              placeholder="Type something..."
              onChange={(e) => setFormData(e.target.value)}
            />
            <br />
            <button onClick={() => setIsOpen(false)}>Close</button>
          </div>
        );
      });

      function Parent() {
        const dialogRef = useRef();

        return (
          <div>
            <h1>useImperativeHandle Dialog Example</h1>
            <button onClick={() => dialogRef.current.open()}>Open Dialog</button>
            <button onClick={() => dialogRef.current.reset()}>Reset Dialog</button>
            <button onClick={() => dialogRef.current.close()}>Close Dialog</button>

            <Dialog ref={dialogRef} />
          </div>
        );
      }

      export default Parent;
      ```

301. ### When should you use useImperativeHandle?
      The useImperativeHandler hook will be used in below cases:

      *   You want to expose **imperative methods** from a child component 
            - Custom input controls exposing `focus`, `clear`, or `validate` methods
            - Modal components exposing `open()` and `close()` methods
            - Scroll containers exposing `scrollToTop()` or `scrollToBottom()` methods
      *   You want to **hide internal implementation** but provide controlled external access.
      *   You're building **reusable component libraries** (e.g., inputs, modals, form controls).
  
**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

302. ### Is that possible to use useImperativeHandle without forwardRef?
        **No.** `useImperativeHandle` only works when the component is wrapped in `forwardRef`. It's the combination that allows parent components to use a `ref` on a function component.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

303. ### How is useMemo different from useCallback?
     The following table compares both useMemo and useCallback:

      | Feature | `useMemo` | `useCallback` |
      | --- | --- | --- |
      | **Purpose** | Memoizes the **result of a computation** | Memoizes a **function reference** |
      | **Returns** | A **value** (e.g., result of a function) | A **function** |
      | **Usage** | `useMemo(() => computeValue(), [deps])` | `useCallback(() => doSomething(), [deps])` |
      | **Primary Use Case** | Avoid expensive recalculations | Prevent unnecessary re-creations of functions |
      | **Common Scenario** | Filtering, sorting, calculating derived data | Passing callbacks to child components |
      | **When It's Useful** | When the value is expensive to compute | When referential equality matters (e.g., props) |
      | **Recomputed When** | Dependencies change | Dependencies change |
      | **Returned Value Type** | Any (number, object, array, etc.) | Always a function |
      | **Overhead** | Slight (evaluates a function and caches result) | Slight (caches a function reference) |

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

304. ### Does useMemo prevent re-rendering of child components?

        The `useMemo` hook **does not directly prevent re-rendering of child components**. Its main purpose is to memoize the result of an expensive computation so that it doesn’t get recalculated unless its dependencies change. While this can improve performance, it doesn’t inherently control whether a child component re-renders.
        
        However, `useMemo` **can help prevent re-renders** when the memoized value is passed as a prop to a child component that is wrapped in `React.memo`. In that case, if the memoized value doesn’t change between renders (i.e., it has the same reference), React.memo can skip re-rendering the child. So, while `useMemo` doesn’t stop renders on its own, it **works in combination** with tools like `React.memo` to optimize rendering behavior.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

305. ### What is `useCallback` and why is it used?

        The `useCallback` is a React Hook used to memoize **function definitions** between renders. It returns the same function reference unless its dependencies change. This is especially useful when passing callbacks to optimized child components (e.g. those wrapped in `React.memo`) to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
        
        **Example:**
        
        ```css
        const handleClick = useCallback(() => {
          console.log('Button clicked');
        }, []);
        ```
        
        Without `useCallback`, a new function is created on every render, potentially causing child components to re-render unnecessarily.

306. ### What are Custom React Hooks, and How Can You Develop One?

      **Custom Hooks** in React are JavaScript functions that allow you to **extract and reuse component logic** using React’s built-in Hooks like `useState`, `useEffect`, etc.

      They start with the word **"use"** and let you encapsulate logic that multiple components might share—such as fetching data, handling forms, or managing timers—without repeating code.

      Let's explain the custom hook usage with `useFetchData` example. The `useFetchData` custom Hook is a reusable function in React that simplifies the process of fetching data from an API. It encapsulates common logic such as initiating the fetch request, managing loading and error states, and storing the fetched data. By using built-in Hooks like `useState` and `useEffect`, `useFetchData` provides a clean interface that returns the `data`, `loading`, and `error` values, which can be directly used in components.

      ```jsx
      import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

      function useFetchData(url) {
        const [data, setData] = useState(null);     // Holds the response
        const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true); // Loading state
        const [error, setError] = useState(null);     // Error state

        useEffect(() => {
          let isMounted = true; // Prevent setting state on unmounted component
          setLoading(true);

          fetch(url)
            .then((response) => {
              if (!response.ok) throw new Error('Network response was not ok');
              return response.json();
            })
            .then((json) => {
              if (isMounted) {
                setData(json);
                setLoading(false);
              }
            })
            .catch((err) => {
              if (isMounted) {
                setError(err.message);
                setLoading(false);
              }
            });

          return () => {
            isMounted = false; // Clean-up function to avoid memory leaks
          };
        }, [url]);

        return { data, loading, error };
      }
      ```

      The above custom hook can be used to retrieve users data for `AuthorList`, `ReviewerList` components.

      **Example: AuthorList component**
      ```jsx
      function AuthorList() {
        const { data, loading, error } = useFetchData('https://api.example.com/authors');

        if (loading) return <p>Loading authors...</p>;
        if (error) return <p>Error: {error}</p>;

        return (
          <ul>
            {data.map((author) => (
              <li key={author.id}>{author.name}</li>
            ))}
          </ul>
        );
      }
      ```
     
      Some of the benefits of custom hooks are:
       *   Promotes **code reuse**
       *   Keeps components **clean and focused**
       *   Makes complex logic **easier to test and maintain**

308. ### How does React Fiber works? Explain in detail.

      React Fiber is the **core engine** that enables advanced features like **concurrent rendering**, **prioritization**, and **interruptibility** in React. Here's how it works:
          
      ### 1. **Fiber Tree Structure**
          
      Each component in your app is represented by a **Fiber node** in a tree structure. A Fiber node contains:
      *   Component type
      *   Props & state
      *   Pointers to parent, child, and sibling nodes
      *   Effect tags to track changes (e.g., update, placement)
      *   This forms the **Fiber Tree**, a data structure React uses instead of the traditional call stack.
          
      ### 2. **Two Phases of Rendering**
          
        #### **A. Render Phase (work-in-progress)**
          
      *   React builds a **work-in-progress Fiber tree**.
      *   It walks through each component (begin phase), calculates what needs to change, and collects side effects (complete phase).
      *   This phase is **interruptible**—React can pause it and resume later.
        #### **B. Commit Phase**
          
      *   React applies changes to the **Real DOM**.
      *   Runs lifecycle methods (e.g., `componentDidMount`, `useEffect`).
      *   This phase is **non-interruptible** but fast.
          
        ### 3. **Work Units and Scheduling**
          
      *   React breaks rendering into **units of work** (small tasks).
      *   These units are scheduled based on **priority** using the **React Scheduler**.
      *   If time runs out (e.g., user starts typing), React can **pause and yield** control back to the browser.
          
        ### 4. **Double Buffering with Two Trees**
          
      *   React maintains two trees:
      *   **Current Tree** – what's visible on the screen.
      *   **Work-In-Progress Tree** – the next version being built in memory.
      *   Only after the new tree is fully ready, React **commits** it, making it the new current tree.
          
        ### 5. **Concurrency and Prioritization**
          
      *   React can prepare multiple versions of UI at once (e.g., during slow data loading).
      *   Updates can be **assigned priorities**, so urgent updates (like clicks) are handled faster than background work.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

309. ### What is the useId hook and when should you use it?

     The `useId` hook is a React hook introduced in React 18 that generates **unique IDs** that are stable across server and client renders. It's primarily used for **accessibility attributes** like linking form labels to inputs.

     #### Syntax
     ```js
     const id = useId();
     ```

     #### Example: Accessible Form Input
     ```jsx
     import { useId } from 'react';

     function EmailField() {
       const id = useId();
       
       return (
         <div>
           <label htmlFor={id}>Email:</label>
           <input id={id} type="email" />
         </div>
       );
     }
     ```

     #### When to Use
     - Generating unique IDs for form elements (`htmlFor`, `aria-describedby`, `aria-labelledby`)
     - Creating stable IDs in server-side rendering (SSR) applications
     - Avoiding ID collisions when the same component is rendered multiple times

     #### When NOT to Use
     - As keys in a list (use data-based keys instead)
     - As CSS selectors or query selectors
     - For any purpose that requires the ID to be predictable

     **Note:** The IDs generated by `useId` contain colons (`:`) which may not work in CSS selectors. For multiple related IDs, you can use the same `id` as a prefix: `${id}-firstName`, `${id}-lastName`.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

310. ### What is the useDeferredValue hook?

     The `useDeferredValue` hook is used to **defer updating a part of the UI** to keep other parts responsive. It accepts a value and returns a "deferred" version of that value that may lag behind. This is useful for optimizing performance when rendering expensive components.

     #### Syntax
     ```js
     const deferredValue = useDeferredValue(value);
     ```

     #### Example: Search with Deferred Results
     ```jsx
     import { useState, useDeferredValue, useMemo } from 'react';

     function SearchResults({ query }) {
       // Expensive computation or large list filtering
       const results = useMemo(() => {
         return largeDataSet.filter(item => 
           item.name.toLowerCase().includes(query.toLowerCase())
         );
       }, [query]);

       return (
         <ul>
           {results.map(item => <li key={item.id}>{item.name}</li>)}
         </ul>
       );
     }

     function SearchPage() {
       const [query, setQuery] = useState('');
       const deferredQuery = useDeferredValue(query);
       const isStale = query !== deferredQuery;

       return (
         <div>
           <input 
             value={query} 
             onChange={(e) => setQuery(e.target.value)}
             placeholder="Search..."
           />
           <div style={{ opacity: isStale ? 0.5 : 1 }}>
             <SearchResults query={deferredQuery} />
           </div>
         </div>
       );
     }
     ```

     The input stays responsive while the expensive `SearchResults` component re-renders with a slight delay using the deferred value.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

311. ### What is the useTransition hook and how does it differ from useDeferredValue?

     The `useTransition` hook allows you to mark certain state updates as **non-urgent transitions**, keeping the UI responsive during expensive re-renders. It returns a `isPending` flag and a `startTransition` function.

     #### Syntax
     ```js
     const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition();
     ```

     #### Example: Tab Switching
     ```jsx
     import { useState, useTransition } from 'react';

     function TabContainer() {
       const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition();
       const [tab, setTab] = useState('home');

       function selectTab(nextTab) {
         startTransition(() => {
           setTab(nextTab);
         });
       }

       return (
         <div>
           <button onClick={() => selectTab('home')}>Home</button>
           <button onClick={() => selectTab('posts')}>Posts (slow)</button>
           <button onClick={() => selectTab('contact')}>Contact</button>
           
           {isPending && <Spinner />}
           
           {tab === 'home' && <HomeTab />}
           {tab === 'posts' && <PostsTab />}  {/* Expensive component */}
           {tab === 'contact' && <ContactTab />}
         </div>
       );
     }
     ```

     #### Differences from useDeferredValue

     | Feature | useTransition | useDeferredValue |
     |---------|--------------|------------------|
     | Controls | State updates (wraps `setState`) | Values (wraps a value) |
     | Use case | When you control the state update | When you receive a value from props or other hooks |
     | Returns | `[isPending, startTransition]` | Deferred value |
     | Pending state | Built-in `isPending` flag | Manual comparison needed |

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

312. ### What is the useSyncExternalStore hook?

     The `useSyncExternalStore` hook is designed to **subscribe to external stores** (non-React state sources) in a way that's compatible with concurrent rendering. It's primarily used by library authors for state management libraries.

     #### Syntax
     ```js
     const state = useSyncExternalStore(subscribe, getSnapshot, getServerSnapshot?);
     ```

     - **subscribe**: Function to subscribe to the store, returns an unsubscribe function
     - **getSnapshot**: Function that returns the current store value
     - **getServerSnapshot**: Optional function for SSR that returns the initial server snapshot

     #### Example: Browser Online Status
     ```jsx
     import { useSyncExternalStore } from 'react';

     function getSnapshot() {
       return navigator.onLine;
     }

     function subscribe(callback) {
       window.addEventListener('online', callback);
       window.addEventListener('offline', callback);
       return () => {
         window.removeEventListener('online', callback);
         window.removeEventListener('offline', callback);
       };
     }

     function useOnlineStatus() {
       return useSyncExternalStore(subscribe, getSnapshot, () => true);
     }

     function StatusBar() {
       const isOnline = useOnlineStatus();
       return <h1>{isOnline ? '✅ Online' : '❌ Disconnected'}</h1>;
     }
     ```

     This hook ensures that when the external store changes, React re-renders consistently without tearing (showing inconsistent data).

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

313. ### What is the useInsertionEffect hook?

     The `useInsertionEffect` hook is designed for **CSS-in-JS library authors** to inject styles into the DOM before any layout effects run. It fires synchronously before DOM mutations.

     #### Syntax
     ```js
     useInsertionEffect(() => {
       // Insert styles here
       return () => {
         // Cleanup
       };
     }, [dependencies]);
     ```

     #### Execution Order
     ```
     1. useInsertionEffect  → Inject styles
     2. DOM mutations       → React updates DOM
     3. useLayoutEffect     → Read layout, synchronously re-render if needed
     4. Browser paint       → User sees the result
     5. useEffect           → Side effects run
     ```

     #### Example: Dynamic Style Injection
     ```jsx
     import { useInsertionEffect } from 'react';

     let isInserted = new Set();

     function useCSS(rule) {
       useInsertionEffect(() => {
         if (!isInserted.has(rule)) {
           isInserted.add(rule);
           const style = document.createElement('style');
           style.textContent = rule;
           document.head.appendChild(style);
         }
       }, [rule]);
     }

     function Button() {
       useCSS('.dynamic-btn { background: blue; color: white; }');
       return <button className="dynamic-btn">Click me</button>;
     }
     ```

     **Note:** This hook is not intended for application code. It's specifically for CSS-in-JS libraries like styled-components or Emotion to prevent style flickering.

314. ### How do you share state logic between components using custom hooks?

     Custom hooks allow you to **extract and share stateful logic** between components without changing their hierarchy. The state itself is not shared—each component using the hook gets its own isolated state.

     #### Example: useLocalStorage Hook
     ```jsx
     import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

     function useLocalStorage(key, initialValue) {
       // Get stored value or use initial value
       const [storedValue, setStoredValue] = useState(() => {
         try {
           const item = window.localStorage.getItem(key);
           return item ? JSON.parse(item) : initialValue;
         } catch (error) {
           console.error(error);
           return initialValue;
         }
       });

       // Update localStorage when state changes
       useEffect(() => {
         try {
           window.localStorage.setItem(key, JSON.stringify(storedValue));
         } catch (error) {
           console.error(error);
         }
       }, [key, storedValue]);

       return [storedValue, setStoredValue];
     }

     // Usage in multiple components
     function ThemeToggle() {
       const [theme, setTheme] = useLocalStorage('theme', 'light');
       return (
         <button onClick={() => setTheme(theme === 'light' ? 'dark' : 'light')}>
           Current: {theme}
         </button>
       );
     }

     function FontSizeSelector() {
       const [fontSize, setFontSize] = useLocalStorage('fontSize', 16);
       return (
         <input 
           type="range" 
           value={fontSize} 
           onChange={(e) => setFontSize(Number(e.target.value))} 
         />
       );
     }
     ```

     Both components use `useLocalStorage`, but each has **its own independent state** that persists to localStorage.

315. ### What is the useDebugValue hook?

     The `useDebugValue` hook is used to **display a label** for custom hooks in **React DevTools**. It helps developers debug custom hooks by showing meaningful information.

     #### Syntax
     ```js
     useDebugValue(value);
     useDebugValue(value, formatFn); // With optional formatter
     ```

     #### Example: Custom Hook with Debug Value
     ```jsx
     import { useState, useEffect, useDebugValue } from 'react';

     function useOnlineStatus() {
       const [isOnline, setIsOnline] = useState(true);

       useEffect(() => {
         const handleOnline = () => setIsOnline(true);
         const handleOffline = () => setIsOnline(false);
         
         window.addEventListener('online', handleOnline);
         window.addEventListener('offline', handleOffline);
         
         return () => {
           window.removeEventListener('online', handleOnline);
           window.removeEventListener('offline', handleOffline);
         };
       }, []);

       // Shows "OnlineStatus: Online" or "OnlineStatus: Offline" in DevTools
       useDebugValue(isOnline ? 'Online' : 'Offline');

       return isOnline;
     }
     ```

     #### With Formatting Function (for expensive computations)
     ```jsx
     function useUser(userId) {
       const [user, setUser] = useState(null);
       
       // The format function only runs when DevTools is open
       useDebugValue(user, (user) => user ? `User: ${user.name}` : 'Loading...');
       
       return user;
     }
     ```

     **Note:** Only use `useDebugValue` in custom hooks that are part of shared libraries. It's not necessary for every custom hook in application code.

316. ### How do you handle cleanup in useEffect?

     The cleanup function in `useEffect` is used to **clean up side effects** before the component unmounts or before the effect runs again. This prevents memory leaks, stale data, and unexpected behavior.

     #### Syntax
     ```js
     useEffect(() => {
       // Setup code
       
       return () => {
         // Cleanup code
       };
     }, [dependencies]);
     ```

     #### Common Cleanup Scenarios

     **1. Event Listeners**
     ```jsx
     useEffect(() => {
       const handleResize = () => setWidth(window.innerWidth);
       window.addEventListener('resize', handleResize);
       
       return () => window.removeEventListener('resize', handleResize);
     }, []);
     ```

     **2. Timers and Intervals**
     ```jsx
     useEffect(() => {
       const intervalId = setInterval(() => {
         setCount(c => c + 1);
       }, 1000);
       
       return () => clearInterval(intervalId);
     }, []);
     ```

     **3. Subscriptions**
     ```jsx
     useEffect(() => {
       const subscription = dataSource.subscribe(handleChange);
       
       return () => subscription.unsubscribe();
     }, [dataSource]);
     ```

     **4. Abort Fetch Requests**
     ```jsx
     useEffect(() => {
       const controller = new AbortController();
       
       fetch(url, { signal: controller.signal })
         .then(response => response.json())
         .then(data => setData(data))
         .catch(err => {
           if (err.name !== 'AbortError') {
             setError(err);
           }
         });
       
       return () => controller.abort();
     }, [url]);
     ```

     **When Cleanup Runs:**
     - Before the component unmounts
     - Before re-running the effect when dependencies change

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

316. ### What are the differences between useEffect and useEvent (experimental)?

     `useEvent` is an **experimental hook** (not yet stable in React) designed to solve the problem of creating **stable event handlers** that always access the latest props and state without causing re-renders or needing to be in dependency arrays.

     #### The Problem useEvent Solves
     ```jsx
     // Problem: onTick changes on every render, causing interval to reset
     function Timer({ onTick }) {
       useEffect(() => {
         const id = setInterval(() => {
           onTick(); // Uses stale closure if onTick is not in deps
         }, 1000);
         return () => clearInterval(id);
       }, [onTick]); // Adding onTick causes interval to reset frequently
     }
     ```

     #### Solution with useEvent (Experimental)
     ```jsx
     import { useEvent } from 'react'; // Experimental

     function Timer({ onTick }) {
       const stableOnTick = useEvent(onTick);

       useEffect(() => {
         const id = setInterval(() => {
           stableOnTick(); // Always calls latest onTick
         }, 1000);
         return () => clearInterval(id);
       }, []); // No dependency needed!
     }
     ```

     #### Key Differences

     | Feature | useEffect | useEvent (experimental) |
     |---------|-----------|------------------------|
     | Purpose | Run side effects | Create stable callbacks |
     | Runs | After render | During render (creates function) |
     | Returns | Cleanup function | Stable event handler |
     | Closure | Captures values at render time | Always accesses latest values |
     | Dependencies | Must list all used values | Not needed in other hooks' deps |

     **Note:** Until `useEvent` is stable, you can use `useCallback` with `useRef` as a workaround for stable callbacks.

317. ### What are the best practices for using React Hooks?

     Following best practices ensures your hooks are predictable, maintainable, and bug-free.

     #### 1. **Follow the Rules of Hooks**
     - Only call hooks at the top level (not inside loops, conditions, or nested functions)
     - Only call hooks from React functions (components or custom hooks)

     #### 2. **Use the ESLint Plugin**
     ```bash
     npm install eslint-plugin-react-hooks --save-dev
     ```
     ```json
     {
       "plugins": ["react-hooks"],
       "rules": {
         "react-hooks/rules-of-hooks": "error",
         "react-hooks/exhaustive-deps": "warn"
       }
     }
     ```

     #### 3. **Keep Hooks Focused and Simple**
     ```jsx
     // ❌ Bad: One hook doing too much
     function useEverything() {
       const [user, setUser] = useState(null);
       const [posts, setPosts] = useState([]);
       const [theme, setTheme] = useState('light');
       // ... lots of unrelated logic
     }

     // ✅ Good: Separate concerns
     function useUser() { /* user logic */ }
     function usePosts() { /* posts logic */ }
     function useTheme() { /* theme logic */ }
     ```

     #### 4. **Use Descriptive Names for Custom Hooks**
     ```jsx
     // ❌ Bad
     function useData() { }

     // ✅ Good
     function useUserAuthentication() { }
     function useFetchProducts() { }
     function useFormValidation() { }
     ```

     #### 5. **Properly Manage Dependencies**
     ```jsx
     // ❌ Bad: Missing dependency
     useEffect(() => {
       fetchUser(userId);
     }, []); // userId is missing

     // ✅ Good: All dependencies listed
     useEffect(() => {
       fetchUser(userId);
     }, [userId]);
     ```

     #### 6. **Avoid Inline Object/Function Dependencies**
     ```jsx
     // ❌ Bad: New object on every render
     useEffect(() => {
       doSomething(options);
     }, [{ page: 1, limit: 10 }]); // Always different reference

     // ✅ Good: Memoize or extract
     const options = useMemo(() => ({ page: 1, limit: 10 }), []);
     useEffect(() => {
       doSomething(options);
     }, [options]);
     ```

     #### 7. **Clean Up Side Effects**
     Always return a cleanup function when subscribing to events, timers, or external data sources.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

## Old Q&A

1. ### Why should we not update the state directly?

   If you try to update the state directly then it won't re-render the component.

   ```javascript
   //Wrong
   this.state.message = "Hello world";
   ```

   Instead use `setState()` method. It schedules an update to a component's state object. When state changes, the component responds by re-rendering.

   ```javascript
   //Correct
   this.setState({ message: "Hello World" });
   ```

   **Note:** You can directly assign to the state object either in _constructor_ or using latest javascript's class field declaration syntax.

   **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

2. ### What is the purpose of callback function as an argument of `setState()`?

    The callback function provided as the second argument to `setState` is executed after the state has been updated and the component has re-rendered. Because `setState()` is asynchronous, you cannot reliably perform actions that require the updated state immediately after calling `setState`. The callback ensures your code runs only after the update and re-render are complete.

    #### Example

    ```jsx
    this.setState({ name: "Sudheer" }, () => {
      console.log("The name has been updated and the component has re-rendered.");
    });
    ```

    #### When to use the callback?

    Use the `setState` callback when you need to perform an action immediately after the DOM has been updated in response to a state change. i.e, The callback is a reliable way to perform actions after a state update and re-render, especially when the timing is critical due to the asynchronous nature of state updates in React. For example, if you need to interact with the updated DOM, trigger analytics, or perform further computations that depend on the new state or rendered output.

    #### Note

    - In modern React (with function components), you can achieve similar effects using the `useEffect` hook to respond to state changes.
    - In class components, you can also use lifecycle methods like `componentDidUpdate` for broader post-update logic.
    - The `setState` callback is still useful for one-off actions that directly follow a specific state change.

   **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

3. ### How to bind methods or event handlers in JSX callbacks?

   There are 3 possible ways to achieve this in class components:

   1. **Binding in Constructor:** In JavaScript classes, the methods are not bound by default. The same rule applies for React event handlers defined as class methods. Normally we bind them in constructor.

      ```javascript
      class User extends Component {
        constructor(props) {
          super(props);
          this.handleClick = this.handleClick.bind(this);
        }
        handleClick() {
          console.log("SingOut triggered");
        }
        render() {
          return <button onClick={this.handleClick}>SingOut</button>;
        }
      }
      ```

   2. **Public class fields syntax:** If you don't like to use bind approach then _public class fields syntax_ can be used to correctly bind callbacks. The Create React App enables this syntax by default.

      ```jsx harmony
      handleClick = () => {
        console.log("SingOut triggered", this);
      };
      ```

      ```jsx harmony
      <button onClick={this.handleClick}>SingOut</button>
      ```

   3. **Arrow functions in callbacks:** It is possible to use _arrow functions_ directly in the callbacks.

      ```jsx harmony
      handleClick() {
          console.log('SingOut triggered');
      }
      render() {
          return <button onClick={() => this.handleClick()}>SignOut</button>;
      }
      ```

   **Note:** If the callback is passed as prop to child components, those components might do an extra re-rendering. In those cases, it is preferred to go with `.bind()` or _public class fields syntax_ approach considering performance.

   **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

4. ### How to pass a parameter to an event handler or callback?

   You can use an _arrow function_ to wrap around an _event handler_ and pass parameters:

   ```jsx harmony
   <button onClick={() => this.handleClick(id)} />
   ```

   This is an equivalent to calling `.bind`:

   ```jsx harmony
   <button onClick={this.handleClick.bind(this, id)} />
   ```

   Apart from these two approaches, you can also pass arguments to a function which is defined as arrow function

   ```jsx harmony
   <button onClick={this.handleClick(id)} />;
   handleClick = (id) => () => {
     console.log("Hello, your ticket number is", id);
   };
   ```

   **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

5. ### What is the use of refs?

   The _ref_ is used to return a reference to the element. They _should be avoided_ in most cases, however, they can be useful when you need a direct access to the DOM element or an instance of a component.

   **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

6. ### How to create refs?

   There are two approaches

   1. This is a recently added approach. _Refs_ are created using `React.createRef()` method and attached to React elements via the `ref` attribute. In order to use _refs_ throughout the component, just assign the _ref_ to the instance property within constructor.

      ```jsx harmony
      class MyComponent extends React.Component {
        constructor(props) {
          super(props);
          this.myRef = React.createRef();
        }
        render() {
          return <div ref={this.myRef} />;
        }
      }
      ```

   2. You can also use ref callbacks approach regardless of React version. For example, the search bar component's input element is accessed as follows,
      ```jsx harmony
      class SearchBar extends Component {
        constructor(props) {
          super(props);
          this.txtSearch = null;
          this.state = { term: "" };
          this.setInputSearchRef = (e) => {
            this.txtSearch = e;
          };
        }
        onInputChange(event) {
          this.setState({ term: this.txtSearch.value });
        }
        render() {
          return (
            <input
              value={this.state.term}
              onChange={this.onInputChange.bind(this)}
              ref={this.setInputSearchRef}
            />
          );
        }
      }
      ```

   You can also use _refs_ in function components using **closures**.
   **Note**: You can also use inline ref callbacks even though it is not a recommended approach.

   **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

7. ### What are forward refs?

   _Ref forwarding_ is a feature that lets some components take a _ref_ they receive, and pass it further down to a child.

   ```jsx harmony
   const ButtonElement = React.forwardRef((props, ref) => (
     <button ref={ref} className="CustomButton">
       {props.children}
     </button>
   ));

   // Create ref to the DOM button:
   const ref = React.createRef();
   <ButtonElement ref={ref}>{"Forward Ref"}</ButtonElement>;
   ```

   **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

8. ### Which is preferred option with in callback refs and findDOMNode()?

   It is preferred to use _callback refs_ over `findDOMNode()` API. Because `findDOMNode()` prevents certain improvements in React in the future.

   The **legacy** approach of using `findDOMNode`:

   ```javascript
   class MyComponent extends Component {
     componentDidMount() {
       findDOMNode(this).scrollIntoView();
     }

     render() {
       return <div />;
     }
   }
   ```

   The recommended approach is:

   ```javascript
   class MyComponent extends Component {
     constructor(props) {
       super(props);
       this.node = createRef();
     }
     componentDidMount() {
       this.node.current.scrollIntoView();
     }

     render() {
       return <div ref={this.node} />;
     }
   }
   ```

   **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

9. ### Why are String Refs legacy?

   If you worked with React before, you might be familiar with an older API where the `ref` attribute is a string, like `ref={'textInput'}`, and the DOM node is accessed as `this.refs.textInput`. We advise against it because _string refs have below issues_, and are considered legacy. String refs were **removed in React v16**.

   1. They _force React to keep track of currently executing component_. This is problematic because it makes react module stateful, and thus causes weird errors when react module is duplicated in the bundle.
   2. They are _not composable_ — if a library puts a ref on the passed child, the user can't put another ref on it. Callback refs are perfectly composable.
   3. They _don't work with static analysis_ like Flow. Flow can't guess the magic that framework does to make the string ref appear on `this.refs`, as well as its type (which could be different). Callback refs are friendlier to static analysis.
   4. It doesn't work as most people would expect with the "render callback" pattern (e.g. <DataGrid renderRow={this.renderRow} />)

      ```jsx harmony
      class MyComponent extends Component {
        renderRow = (index) => {
          // This won't work. Ref will get attached to DataTable rather than MyComponent:
          return <input ref={"input-" + index} />;

          // This would work though! Callback refs are awesome.
          return <input ref={(input) => (this["input-" + index] = input)} />;
        };

        render() {
          return (
            <DataTable data={this.props.data} renderRow={this.renderRow} />
          );
        }
      }
      ```

   **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

10. ### What are the different phases of component lifecycle?

    The component lifecycle has three distinct lifecycle phases:

    1. **Mounting:** The component is ready to mount in the browser DOM. This phase covers initialization from `constructor()`, `getDerivedStateFromProps()`, `render()`, and `componentDidMount()` lifecycle methods.

    2. **Updating:** In this phase, the component gets updated in two ways, sending the new props and updating the state either from `setState()` or `forceUpdate()`. This phase covers `getDerivedStateFromProps()`, `shouldComponentUpdate()`, `render()`, `getSnapshotBeforeUpdate()` and `componentDidUpdate()` lifecycle methods.

    3. **Unmounting:** In this last phase, the component is not needed and gets unmounted from the browser DOM. This phase includes `componentWillUnmount()` lifecycle method.

    It's worth mentioning that React internally has a concept of phases when applying changes to the DOM. They are separated as follows

    4. **Render** The component will render without any side effects. This applies to Pure components and in this phase, React can pause, abort, or restart the render.

    5. **Pre-commit** Before the component actually applies the changes to the DOM, there is a moment that allows React to read from the DOM through the `getSnapshotBeforeUpdate()`.

    6. **Commit** React works with the DOM and executes the final lifecycles respectively `componentDidMount()` for mounting, `componentDidUpdate()` for updating, and `componentWillUnmount()` for unmounting.

    React 16.3+ Phases (or an [interactive version](http://projects.wojtekmaj.pl/react-lifecycle-methods-diagram/))

    Before React 16.3

    ![phases 16.2](images/phases.png)

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

11. ### What are the lifecycle methods of React?

    Before React 16.3

    - **componentWillMount:** Executed before rendering and is used for App level configuration in your root component.
    - **componentDidMount:** Executed after first rendering and here all AJAX requests, DOM or state updates, and set up event listeners should occur.
    - **componentWillReceiveProps:** Executed when particular prop updates to trigger state transitions.
    - **shouldComponentUpdate:** Determines if the component will be updated or not. By default it returns `true`. If you are sure that the component doesn't need to render after state or props are updated, you can return false value. It is a great place to improve performance as it allows you to prevent a re-render if component receives new prop.
    - **componentWillUpdate:** Executed before re-rendering the component when there are props & state changes confirmed by `shouldComponentUpdate()` which returns true.
    - **componentDidUpdate:** Mostly it is used to update the DOM in response to prop or state changes.
    - **componentWillUnmount:** It will be used to cancel any outgoing network requests, or remove all event listeners associated with the component.

    React 16.3+

    - **getDerivedStateFromProps:** Invoked right before calling `render()` and is invoked on _every_ render. This exists for rare use cases where you need a derived state. Worth reading [if you need derived state](https://reactjs.org/blog/2018/06/07/you-probably-dont-need-derived-state.html).
    - **componentDidMount:** Executed after first rendering and where all AJAX requests, DOM or state updates, and set up event listeners should occur.
    - **shouldComponentUpdate:** Determines if the component will be updated or not. By default, it returns `true`. If you are sure that the component doesn't need to render after the state or props are updated, you can return a false value. It is a great place to improve performance as it allows you to prevent a re-render if component receives a new prop.
    - **getSnapshotBeforeUpdate:** Executed right before rendered output is committed to the DOM. Any value returned by this will be passed into `componentDidUpdate()`. This is useful to capture information from the DOM i.e. scroll position.
    - **componentDidUpdate:** Mostly it is used to update the DOM in response to prop or state changes. This will not fire if `shouldComponentUpdate()` returns `false`.
    - **componentWillUnmount** It will be used to cancel any outgoing network requests, or remove all event listeners associated with the component.

12. ### How to create props proxy for HOC component?

    You can add/edit props passed to the component using _props proxy_ pattern like this:

    ```jsx harmony
    function HOC(WrappedComponent) {
      return class Test extends Component {
        render() {
          const newProps = {
            title: "New Header",
            footer: false,
            showFeatureX: false,
            showFeatureY: true,
          };

          return <WrappedComponent {...this.props} {...newProps} />;
        }
      };
    }
    ```

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

13. ### What is context?

    _Context_ provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level.

    For example, authenticated users, locale preferences, UI themes need to be accessed in the application by many components.

    ```javascript
    const { Provider, Consumer } = React.createContext(defaultValue);
    ```

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

14. ### What is the purpose of using super constructor with props argument?

    A child class constructor cannot make use of `this` reference until the `super()` method has been called. The same applies to ES6 sub-classes as well. The main reason for passing props parameter to `super()` call is to access `this.props` in your child constructors.

    **Passing props:**

    ```javascript
    class MyComponent extends React.Component {
      constructor(props) {
        super(props);

        console.log(this.props); // prints { name: 'John', age: 42 }
      }
    }
    ```

    **Not passing props:**

    ```javascript
    class MyComponent extends React.Component {
      constructor(props) {
        super();

        console.log(this.props); // prints undefined

        // but props parameter is still available
        console.log(props); // prints { name: 'John', age: 42 }
      }

      render() {
        // no difference outside constructor
        console.log(this.props); // prints { name: 'John', age: 42 }
      }
    }
    ```

    The above code snippets reveals that `this.props` is different only within the constructor. It would be the same outside the constructor.

15. ### How to set state with a dynamic key name?

    If you are using ES6 or the Babel transpiler to transform your JSX code then you can accomplish this with _computed property names_.

    ```javascript
    handleInputChange(event) {
      this.setState({ [event.target.id]: event.target.value })
    }
    ```

16. ### What would be the common mistake of function being called every time the component renders?

    You need to make sure that function is not being called while passing the function as a parameter.

    ```jsx harmony
    render() {
      // Wrong: handleClick is called instead of passed as a reference!
      return <button onClick={this.handleClick()}>{'Click Me'}</button>
    }
    ```

    Instead, pass the function itself without parenthesis:

    ```jsx harmony
    render() {
      // Correct: handleClick is passed as a reference!
      return <button onClick={this.handleClick}>{'Click Me'}</button>
    }
    ```

17. ### What are error boundaries in React v16?

    _Error boundaries_ are components that catch JavaScript errors anywhere in their child component tree, log those errors, and display a fallback UI instead of the component tree that crashed.

    A class component becomes an error boundary if it defines a new lifecycle method called `componentDidCatch(error, info)` or `static getDerivedStateFromError() `:

    ```jsx harmony
    class ErrorBoundary extends React.Component {
      constructor(props) {
        super(props);
        this.state = { hasError: false };
      }

      componentDidCatch(error, info) {
        // You can also log the error to an error reporting service
        logErrorToMyService(error, info);
      }

      static getDerivedStateFromError(error) {
        // Update state so the next render will show the fallback UI.
        return { hasError: true };
      }

      render() {
        if (this.state.hasError) {
          // You can render any custom fallback UI
          return <h1>{"Something went wrong."}</h1>;
        }
        return this.props.children;
      }
    }
    ```

    After that use it as a regular component:

    ```jsx harmony
    <ErrorBoundary>
      <MyWidget />
    </ErrorBoundary>
    ```

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

18. ### How are error boundaries handled in React v15?

    React v15 provided very basic support for _error boundaries_ using `unstable_handleError` method. It has been renamed to `componentDidCatch` in React v16.

19. ### What is the purpose of render method of `react-dom`?

    This method is used to render a React element into the DOM in the supplied container and return a reference to the component. If the React element was previously rendered into container, it will perform an update on it and only mutate the DOM as necessary to reflect the latest changes.

    ```
    ReactDOM.render(element, container, [callback])
    ```

    If the optional callback is provided, it will be executed after the component is rendered or updated.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

20. ### What will happen if you use `setState()` in constructor?

    When you use `setState()`, then apart from assigning to the object state React also re-renders the component and all its children. You would get error like this: _Can only update a mounted or mounting component._ So we need to use `this.state` to initialize variables inside constructor.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

21. ### Is it good to use `setState()` in `componentWillMount()` method?

    Yes, it is safe to use `setState()` inside `componentWillMount()` method. But at the same it is recommended to avoid async initialization in `componentWillMount()` lifecycle method. `componentWillMount()` is invoked immediately before mounting occurs. It is called before `render()`, therefore setting state in this method will not trigger a re-render. Avoid introducing any side-effects or subscriptions in this method. We need to make sure async calls for component initialization happened in `componentDidMount()` instead of `componentWillMount()`.

    ```jsx harmony
    componentDidMount() {
      axios.get(`api/todos`)
        .then((result) => {
          this.setState({
            messages: [...result.data]
          })
        })
    }
    ```

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

22. ### What will happen if you use props in initial state?

    If the props on the component are changed without the component being refreshed, the new prop value will never be displayed because the constructor function will never update the current state of the component. The initialization of state from props only runs when the component is first created.

    The below component won't display the updated input value:

    ```jsx harmony
    class MyComponent extends React.Component {
      constructor(props) {
        super(props);

        this.state = {
          records: [],
          inputValue: this.props.inputValue,
        };
      }

      render() {
        return <div>{this.state.inputValue}</div>;
      }
    }
    ```

    Using props inside render method will update the value:

    ```jsx harmony
    class MyComponent extends React.Component {
      constructor(props) {
        super(props);

        this.state = {
          record: [],
        };
      }

      render() {
        return <div>{this.props.inputValue}</div>;
      }
    }
    ```

23. ### How you use decorators in React?

    You can _decorate_ your _class_ components, which is the same as passing the component into a function. **Decorators** are flexible and readable way of modifying component functionality.

    ```jsx harmony
    @setTitle("Profile")
    class Profile extends React.Component {
      //....
    }

    /*
      title is a string that will be set as a document title
      WrappedComponent is what our decorator will receive when
      put directly above a component class as seen in the example above
    */
    const setTitle = (title) => (WrappedComponent) => {
      return class extends React.Component {
        componentDidMount() {
          document.title = title;
        }

        render() {
          return <WrappedComponent {...this.props} />;
        }
      };
    };
    ```

    **Note:** Decorators are a feature that didn't make it into ES7, but are currently a _stage 2 proposal_.

24. ### What is CRA and its benefits?

    The `create-react-app` CLI tool allows you to quickly create & run React applications with no configuration step.

    Let's create Todo App using _CRA_:

    ```console
    # Installation
    $ npm install -g create-react-app

    # Create new project
    $ create-react-app todo-app
    $ cd todo-app

    # Build, test and run
    $ npm run build
    $ npm run test
    $ npm start
    ```

    It includes everything we need to build a React app:

    1. React, JSX, ES6, and Flow syntax support.
    2. Language extras beyond ES6 like the object spread operator.
    3. Autoprefixed CSS, so you don’t need -webkit- or other prefixes.
    4. A fast interactive unit test runner with built-in support for coverage reporting.
    5. A live development server that warns about common mistakes.
    6. A build script to bundle JS, CSS, and images for production, with hashes and sourcemaps.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

25. ### What is the lifecycle methods order in mounting?

    The lifecycle methods are called in the following order when an instance of a component is being created and inserted into the DOM.

    1. `constructor()`
    2. `static getDerivedStateFromProps()`
    3. `render()`
    4. `componentDidMount()`

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

26. ### What are the lifecycle methods going to be deprecated in React v16?

    The following lifecycle methods going to be unsafe coding practices and will be more problematic with async rendering.

    1. `componentWillMount()`
    2. `componentWillReceiveProps()`
    3. `componentWillUpdate()`

    Starting with React v16.3 these methods are aliased with `UNSAFE_` prefix, and the unprefixed version will be removed in React v17.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

27. ### What is the purpose of `getDerivedStateFromProps()` lifecycle method?

    The new static `getDerivedStateFromProps()` lifecycle method is invoked after a component is instantiated as well as before it is re-rendered. It can return an object to update state, or `null` to indicate that the new props do not require any state updates.

    ```javascript
    class MyComponent extends React.Component {
      static getDerivedStateFromProps(props, state) {
        // ...
      }
    }
    ```

    This lifecycle method along with `componentDidUpdate()` covers all the use cases of `componentWillReceiveProps()`.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

28. ### What is the purpose of `getSnapshotBeforeUpdate()` lifecycle method?

    The new `getSnapshotBeforeUpdate()` lifecycle method is called right before DOM updates. The return value from this method will be passed as the third parameter to `componentDidUpdate()`.

    ```javascript
    class MyComponent extends React.Component {
      getSnapshotBeforeUpdate(prevProps, prevState) {
        // ...
      }
    }
    ```

    This lifecycle method along with `componentDidUpdate()` covers all the use cases of `componentWillUpdate()`.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

29. ### What is the recommended way for naming components?

    It is recommended to name the component by reference instead of using `displayName`.

    Using `displayName` for naming component:

    ```javascript
    export default React.createClass({
      displayName: "TodoApp",
      // ...
    });
    ```

    The **recommended** approach:

    ```javascript
    export default class TodoApp extends React.Component {
      // ...
    }
    ```

    also

    ```javascript
    const TodoApp = () => {
      //...
    };
    export default TodoApp;
    ```

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

30. ### What is the recommended ordering of methods in component class?

    _Recommended_ ordering of methods from _mounting_ to _render stage_:

    1. `static` methods
    2. `constructor()`
    3. `getChildContext()`
    4. `componentWillMount()`
    5. `componentDidMount()`
    6. `componentWillReceiveProps()`
    7. `shouldComponentUpdate()`
    8. `componentWillUpdate()`
    9. `componentDidUpdate()`
    10. `componentWillUnmount()`
    11. click handlers or event handlers like `onClickSubmit()` or `onChangeDescription()`
    12. getter methods for render like `getSelectReason()` or `getFooterContent()`
    13. optional render methods like `renderNavigation()` or `renderProfilePicture()`
    14. `render()`

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

31. ### Why we need to pass a function to setState()?

    The reason behind for this is that `setState()` is an asynchronous operation. React batches state changes for performance reasons, so the state may not change immediately after `setState()` is called. That means you should not rely on the current state when calling `setState()` since you can't be sure what that state will be. The solution is to pass a function to `setState()`, with the previous state as an argument. By doing this you can avoid issues with the user getting the old state value on access due to the asynchronous nature of `setState()`.

    Let's say the initial count value is zero. After three consecutive increment operations, the value is going to be incremented only by one.

    ```javascript
    // assuming this.state.count === 0
    this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 });
    this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 });
    this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 });
    // this.state.count === 1, not 3
    ```

    If we pass a function to `setState()`, the count gets incremented correctly.

    ```javascript
    this.setState((prevState, props) => ({
      count: prevState.count + props.increment,
    }));
    // this.state.count === 3 as expected
    ```

    **(OR)**

    ### Why function is preferred over object for `setState()`?

    React may batch multiple `setState()` calls into a single update for performance. Because `this.props` and `this.state` may be updated asynchronously, you should not rely on their values for calculating the next state.

    This counter example will fail to update as expected:

    ```javascript
    // Wrong
    this.setState({
      counter: this.state.counter + this.props.increment,
    });
    ```

    The preferred approach is to call `setState()` with function rather than object. That function will receive the previous state as the first argument, and the props at the time the update is applied as the second argument.

    ```javascript
    // Correct
    this.setState((prevState, props) => ({
      counter: prevState.counter + props.increment,
    }));
    ```

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

32. ### Why is `isMounted()` an anti-pattern and what is the proper solution?

    The primary use case for `isMounted()` is to avoid calling `setState()` after a component has been unmounted, because it will emit a warning.

    ```javascript
    if (this.isMounted()) {
      this.setState({...})
    }
    ```

    Checking `isMounted()` before calling `setState()` does eliminate the warning, but it also defeats the purpose of the warning. Using `isMounted()` is a code smell because the only reason you would check is because you think you might be holding a reference after the component has unmounted.

    An optimal solution would be to find places where `setState()` might be called after a component has unmounted, and fix them. Such situations most commonly occur due to callbacks, when a component is waiting for some data and gets unmounted before the data arrives. Ideally, any callbacks should be canceled in `componentWillUnmount()`, prior to unmounting.

33. ### What is the difference between constructor and getInitialState?

    You should initialize state in the constructor when using ES6 classes, and `getInitialState()` method when using `React.createClass()`.

    **Using ES6 classes:**

    ```javascript
    class MyComponent extends React.Component {
      constructor(props) {
        super(props);
        this.state = {
          /* initial state */
        };
      }
    }
    ```

    **Using `React.createClass()`:**

    ```javascript
    const MyComponent = React.createClass({
      getInitialState() {
        return {
          /* initial state */
        };
      },
    });
    ```

    **Note:** `React.createClass()` is deprecated and removed in React v16. Use plain JavaScript classes instead.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

34. ### Can you force a component to re-render without calling setState?

    By default, when your component's state or props change, your component will re-render. If your `render()` method depends on some other data, you can tell React that the component needs re-rendering by calling `forceUpdate()`.

    ```javascript
    component.forceUpdate(callback);
    ```

    It is recommended to avoid all uses of `forceUpdate()` and only read from `this.props` and `this.state` in `render()`.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

35. ### What is the difference between `super()` and `super(props)` in React using ES6 classes?

    When you want to access `this.props` in `constructor()` then you should pass props to `super()` method.

    **Using `super(props)`:**

    ```javascript
    class MyComponent extends React.Component {
      constructor(props) {
        super(props);
        console.log(this.props); // { name: 'John', ... }
      }
    }
    ```

    **Using `super()`:**

    ```javascript
    class MyComponent extends React.Component {
      constructor(props) {
        super();
        console.log(this.props); // undefined
      }
    }
    ```

    Outside `constructor()` both will display same value for `this.props`.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

36. ### What is the difference between `setState()` and `replaceState()` methods?

    When you use `setState()` the current and previous states are merged. `replaceState()` throws out the current state, and replaces it with only what you provide. Usually `setState()` is used unless you really need to remove all previous keys for some reason. You can also set state to `false`/`null` in `setState()` instead of using `replaceState()`.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

37. ### How to listen to state changes?

    The `componentDidUpdate` lifecycle method will be called when state changes. You can compare provided state and props values with current state and props to determine if something meaningful changed.

    ```
    componentDidUpdate(object prevProps, object prevState)
    ```

    **Note:** The previous releases of ReactJS also uses `componentWillUpdate(object nextProps, object nextState)` for state changes. It has been deprecated in latest releases.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

38. ### What is the recommended approach of removing an array element in React state?

    The better approach is to use `Array.prototype.filter()` method.

    For example, let's create a `removeItem()` method for updating the state.

    ```javascript
    removeItem(index) {
      this.setState({
        data: this.state.data.filter((item, i) => i !== index)
      })
    }
    ```

39. ### Is it possible to use React without rendering HTML?

    It is possible. Below are the possible options:

    ```jsx harmony
    render() {
      return false
    }
    ```

    ```jsx harmony
    render() {
      return true
    }
    ```

    ```jsx harmony
    render() {
      return null
    }
    ```

    React version >=16.0.0:

    ```jsx harmony
    render() {
      return []
    }
    ```

    ```jsx harmony
    render() {
      return ""
    }
    ```

    React version >=16.2.0:

    ```jsx harmony
    render() {
      return <React.Fragment></React.Fragment>
    }
    ```

    ```jsx harmony
    render() {
      return <></>
    }
    ```

    React version >=18.0.0:

    ```jsx harmony
    render() {
      return undefined
    }
    ```

40. ### What are the possible ways of updating objects in state?

    1.  **Calling `setState()` with an object to merge with state:**

        - Using `Object.assign()` to create a copy of the object:

          ```javascript
          const user = Object.assign({}, this.state.user, { age: 42 });
          this.setState({ user });
          ```

        - Using _spread operator_:

          ```javascript
          const user = { ...this.state.user, age: 42 };
          this.setState({ user });
          ```

    2.  **Calling `setState()` with a function:**

        ```javascript
        this.setState((prevState) => ({
          user: {
            ...prevState.user,
            age: 42,
          },
        }));
        ```

41. ### What are the approaches to include polyfills in your `create-react-app`?

    There are approaches to include polyfills in create-react-app,

    1.  **Manual import from `core-js`:**

        Create a file called (something like) `polyfills.js` and import it into root `index.js` file. Run `npm install core-js` or `yarn add core-js` and import your specific required features.

        ```javascript
        import "core-js/fn/array/find";
        import "core-js/fn/array/includes";
        import "core-js/fn/number/is-nan";
        ```

    2.  **Using Polyfill service:**

        Use the polyfill.io CDN to retrieve custom, browser-specific polyfills by adding this line to `index.html`:

        ```html
        <script src="https://cdn.polyfill.io/v2/polyfill.min.js?features=default,Array.prototype.includes"></script>
        ```

        In the above script we had to explicitly request the `Array.prototype.includes` feature as it is not included in the default feature set.

42. ### How to use https instead of http in create-react-app?

    You just need to use `HTTPS=true` configuration. You can edit your `package.json` scripts section:

    ```json
    "scripts": {
      "start": "set HTTPS=true && react-scripts start"
    }
    ```

    or just run `set HTTPS=true && npm start`

43. ### How to avoid using relative path imports in create-react-app?

    Create a file called `.env` in the project root and write the import path:

    ```
    NODE_PATH=src/app
    ```

    After that restart the development server. Now you should be able to import anything inside `src/app` without relative paths.

44. ### How to update a component every second?

    You need to use `setInterval()` to trigger the change, but you also need to clear the timer when the component unmounts to prevent errors and memory leaks.

    ```javascript
    componentDidMount() {
      this.interval = setInterval(() => this.setState({ time: Date.now() }), 1000)
    }

    componentWillUnmount() {
      clearInterval(this.interval)
    }
    ```

45. ### Why is a component constructor called only once?

    React's _reconciliation_ algorithm assumes that without any information to the contrary, if a custom component appears in the same place on subsequent renders, it's the same component as before, so reuses the previous instance rather than creating a new one.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

46. ### How to define constants in React?

    You can use ES7 `static` field to define constant.

    ```javascript
    class MyComponent extends React.Component {
      static DEFAULT_PAGINATION = 10;
    }
    ```

47. ### How to programmatically trigger click event in React?

    You could use the ref prop to acquire a reference to the underlying `HTMLInputElement` object through a callback, store the reference as a class property, then use that reference to later trigger a click from your event handlers using the `HTMLElement.click` method.

    This can be done in two steps:

    1.  Create ref in render method:

        ```jsx harmony
        <input ref={(input) => (this.inputElement = input)} />
        ```

    2.  Apply click event in your event handler:

        ```javascript
        this.inputElement.click();
        ```

48. ### How to make AJAX call and in which component lifecycle methods should I make an AJAX call?

    You can use AJAX libraries such as Axios, jQuery AJAX, and the browser built-in `fetch`. You should fetch data in the `componentDidMount()` lifecycle method. This is so you can use `setState()` to update your component when the data is retrieved.

    For example, the employees list fetched from API and set local state:

    ```jsx harmony
    class MyComponent extends React.Component {
      constructor(props) {
        super(props);
        this.state = {
          employees: [],
          error: null,
        };
      }

      componentDidMount() {
        fetch("https://api.example.com/items")
          .then((res) => res.json())
          .then(
            (result) => {
              this.setState({
                employees: result.employees,
              });
            },
            (error) => {
              this.setState({ error });
            }
          );
      }

      render() {
        const { error, employees } = this.state;
        if (error) {
          return <div>Error: {error.message}</div>;
        } else {
          return (
            <ul>
              {employees.map((employee) => (
                <li key={employee.name}>
                  {employee.name}-{employee.experience}
                </li>
              ))}
            </ul>
          );
        }
      }
    }
    ```

49. ### What are render props?

    **Render Props** is a simple technique for sharing code between components using a prop whose value is a function. The below component uses render prop which returns a React element.

    ```jsx harmony
    <DataProvider render={(data) => <h1>{`Hello ${data.target}`}</h1>} />
    ```

    Libraries such as React Router and DownShift are using this pattern.

50. ### How to dispatch an action on load?

    You can dispatch an action in `componentDidMount()` method and in `render()` method you can verify the data.

    ```javascript
    class App extends Component {
      componentDidMount() {
        this.props.fetchData();
      }

      render() {
        return this.props.isLoaded ? (
          <div>{"Loaded"}</div>
        ) : (
          <div>{"Not Loaded"}</div>
        );
      }
    }

    const mapStateToProps = (state) => ({
      isLoaded: state.isLoaded,
    });

    const mapDispatchToProps = { fetchData };

    export default connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps)(App);
    ```

51. ### How to use `connect()` from React Redux?

    You need to follow two steps to use your store in your container:

    1.  **Use `mapStateToProps()`:** It maps the state variables from your store to the props that you specify.
    2.  **Connect the above props to your container:** The object returned by the `mapStateToProps` function is connected to the container. You can import `connect()` from `react-redux`.

        ```jsx harmony
        import React from "react";
        import { connect } from "react-redux";

        class App extends React.Component {
          render() {
            return <div>{this.props.containerData}</div>;
          }
        }

        function mapStateToProps(state) {
          return { containerData: state.data };
        }

        export default connect(mapStateToProps)(App);
        ```

52. ### Whats the purpose of `at` symbol in the Redux connect decorator?

    The **@** symbol is in fact a JavaScript expression used to signify decorators. _Decorators_ make it possible to annotate and modify classes and properties at design time.

    Let's take an example setting up Redux without and with a decorator.

    - **Without decorator:**

      ```javascript
      import React from "react";
      import * as actionCreators from "./actionCreators";
      import { bindActionCreators } from "redux";
      import { connect } from "react-redux";

      function mapStateToProps(state) {
        return { todos: state.todos };
      }

      function mapDispatchToProps(dispatch) {
        return { actions: bindActionCreators(actionCreators, dispatch) };
      }

      class MyApp extends React.Component {
        // ...define your main app here
      }

      export default connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps)(MyApp);
      ```

    - **With decorator:**

      ```javascript
      import React from "react";
      import * as actionCreators from "./actionCreators";
      import { bindActionCreators } from "redux";
      import { connect } from "react-redux";

      function mapStateToProps(state) {
        return { todos: state.todos };
      }

      function mapDispatchToProps(dispatch) {
        return { actions: bindActionCreators(actionCreators, dispatch) };
      }

      @connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps)
      export default class MyApp extends React.Component {
        // ...define your main app here
      }
      ```

    The above examples are almost similar except the usage of decorator. The decorator syntax isn't built into any JavaScript runtimes yet, and is still experimental and subject to change. You can use babel for the decorators support.

53. ### How to use TypeScript in `create-react-app` application?

        Starting from react-scripts@3.3.0+ releases onwards, you can now optionally start a new app from a template by appending `--template [template-name]` to the creation command. If you don't select a template, it will create your project with base template. Remember that templates are always named in the format `cra-template-[template-name]`, here you only need to fill the `[template-name]` section.

        The typeScript can be used in your project by appending `--template typescript` to the creation command.

         ```bash
         npx create-react-app my-app --template typescript
         ```

        But if you are using React Scripting between react-scripts@2.1.0 and react-scripts@3.2.x , there is a built-in support for TypeScript. i.e, `create-react-app` now supports TypeScript natively. You can just pass `--typescript` option as below

         ```bash
         npx create-react-app my-app --typescript

         # or

         yarn create react-app my-app --typescript
         ```

         Whereas for lower versions of react scripts, just supply `--scripts-version` option as `react-scripts-ts` while you create a new project. `react-scripts-ts` is a set of adjustments to take the standard `create-react-app` project pipeline and bring TypeScript into the mix.

         Now the project layout should look like the following:

         ```
         my-app/
         ├─ .gitignore
         ├─ images.d.ts
         ├─ node_modules/
         ├─ public/
         ├─ src/
         │  └─ ...
         ├─ package.json
         ├─ tsconfig.json
         ├─ tsconfig.prod.json
         ├─ tsconfig.test.json
         └─ tslint.json
         ```

54. ### Does the statics object work with ES6 classes in React?

    No, `statics` only works with `React.createClass()`:

    ```javascript
    someComponent = React.createClass({
      statics: {
        someMethod: function () {
          // ..
        },
      },
    });
    ```

    But you can write statics inside ES6+ classes as below,

    ```javascript
    class Component extends React.Component {
      static propTypes = {
        // ...
      };

      static someMethod() {
        // ...
      }
    }
    ```

    or writing them outside class as below,

    ```javascript
    class Component extends React.Component {
       ....
    }

    Component.propTypes = {...}
    Component.someMethod = function(){....}
    ```

55. ### Why are inline ref callbacks or functions not recommended?

    If the ref callback is defined as an inline function, it will get called twice during updates, first with null and then again with the DOM element. This is because a new instance of the function is created with each render, so React needs to clear the old ref and set up the new one.

    ```jsx
    class UserForm extends Component {
      handleSubmit = () => {
        console.log("Input Value is: ", this.input.value);
      };

      render() {
        return (
          <form onSubmit={this.handleSubmit}>
            <input type="text" ref={(input) => (this.input = input)} /> //
            Access DOM input in handle submit
            <button type="submit">Submit</button>
          </form>
        );
      }
    }
    ```

    But our expectation is for the ref callback to get called once, when the component mounts. One quick fix is to use the ES7 class property syntax to define the function

    ```jsx
    class UserForm extends Component {
      handleSubmit = () => {
        console.log("Input Value is: ", this.input.value);
      };

      setSearchInput = (input) => {
        this.input = input;
      };

      render() {
        return (
          <form onSubmit={this.handleSubmit}>
            <input type="text" ref={this.setSearchInput} /> // Access DOM input
            in handle submit
            <button type="submit">Submit</button>
          </form>
        );
      }
    }
    ```

56. ### What are HOC factory implementations?

    There are two main ways of implementing HOCs in React.

    1.  Props Proxy (PP) and
    2.  Inheritance Inversion (II).

    But they follow different approaches for manipulating the _WrappedComponent_.

    **Props Proxy**

    In this approach, the render method of the HOC returns a React Element of the type of the WrappedComponent. We also pass through the props that the HOC receives, hence the name **Props Proxy**.

    ```jsx
    function ppHOC(WrappedComponent) {
      return class PP extends React.Component {
        render() {
          return <WrappedComponent {...this.props} />;
        }
      };
    }
    ```

    **Inheritance Inversion**

    In this approach, the returned HOC class (Enhancer) extends the WrappedComponent. It is called Inheritance Inversion because instead of the WrappedComponent extending some Enhancer class, it is passively extended by the Enhancer. In this way the relationship between them seems **inverse**.

    ```jsx
    function iiHOC(WrappedComponent) {
      return class Enhancer extends WrappedComponent {
        render() {
          return super.render();
        }
      };
    }
    ```

57. ### How to use class field declarations syntax in React classes?

    React Class Components can be made much more concise using the class field declarations. You can initialize the local state without using the constructor and declare class methods by using arrow functions without the extra need to bind them.

    Let's take a counter example to demonstrate class field declarations for state without using constructor and methods without binding,

    ```jsx
    class Counter extends Component {
      state = { value: 0 };

      handleIncrement = () => {
        this.setState((prevState) => ({
          value: prevState.value + 1,
        }));
      };

      handleDecrement = () => {
        this.setState((prevState) => ({
          value: prevState.value - 1,
        }));
      };

      render() {
        return (
          <div>
            {this.state.value}

            <button onClick={this.handleIncrement}>+</button>
            <button onClick={this.handleDecrement}>-</button>
          </div>
        );
      }
    }
    ```

58. ### Why do you not need error boundaries for event handlers?

    Error boundaries do not catch errors inside event handlers.

    React doesn’t need error boundaries to recover from errors in event handlers. Unlike the render method and lifecycle methods, the event handlers don’t happen during rendering. So if they throw, React still knows what to display on the screen.

    If you need to catch an error inside an event handler, use the regular JavaScript try / catch statement:

    ```javascript
    class MyComponent extends React.Component {
      constructor(props) {
        super(props);
        this.state = { error: null };
        this.handleClick = this.handleClick.bind(this);
      }

      handleClick() {
        try {
          // Do something that could throw
        } catch (error) {
          this.setState({ error });
        }
      }

      render() {
        if (this.state.error) {
          return <h1>Caught an error.</h1>;
        }
        return <button onClick={this.handleClick}>Click Me</button>;
      }
    }
    ```

    Note that the above example is demonstrating regular JavaScript behavior and doesn’t use error boundaries.

59. ### What is the difference between try catch block and error boundaries?

    Try catch block works with imperative code whereas error boundaries are meant for declarative code to render on the screen.

    For example, the try catch block used for below imperative code

    ```javascript
    try {
      showButton();
    } catch (error) {
      // ...
    }
    ```

    Whereas error boundaries wrap declarative code as below,

    ```javascript
    <ErrorBoundary>
      <MyComponent />
    </ErrorBoundary>
    ```

    So if an error occurs in a **componentDidUpdate** method caused by a **setState** somewhere deep in the tree, it will still correctly propagate to the closest error boundary.

60. ### What is the required method to be defined for a class component?
    The `render()` method is the only required method in a class component. i.e, All methods other than render method are optional for a class component.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

61. ### What are the possible return types of render method?

    Below are the list of following types used and return from render method,

    1.  **React elements:** Elements that instruct React to render a DOM node. It includes html elements such as `<div/>` and user defined elements.
    2.  **Arrays and fragments:** Return multiple elements to render as Arrays and Fragments to wrap multiple elements
    3.  **Portals:** Render children into a different DOM subtree.
    4.  **String and numbers:** Render both Strings and Numbers as text nodes in the DOM
    5.  **Booleans or null:** Doesn't render anything but these types are used to conditionally render content.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

62. ### What is the main purpose of constructor?

    The constructor is mainly used for two purposes,

    1.  To initialize local state by assigning object to this.state
    2.  For binding event handler methods to the instance
        For example, the below code covers both the above cases,

    ```javascript
    constructor(props) {
      super(props);
      // Don't call this.setState() here!
      this.state = { counter: 0 };
      this.handleClick = this.handleClick.bind(this);
    }
    ```

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

63. ### Is it mandatory to define constructor for React component?
    No, it is not mandatory. i.e, If you don’t initialize state and you don’t bind methods, you don’t need to implement a constructor for your React component.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

64. ### Why should not call setState in componentWillUnmount?
    You should not call `setState()` in `componentWillUnmount()` because once a component instance is unmounted, it will never be mounted again.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

65. ### What is the purpose of getDerivedStateFromError?

    This lifecycle method is invoked after an error has been thrown by a descendant component. It receives the error that was thrown as a parameter and should return a value to update state.

    The signature of the lifecycle method is as follows,

    ```javascript
    static getDerivedStateFromError(error)
    ```

    Let us take error boundary use case with the above lifecycle method for demonstration purpose,

    ```javascript
    class ErrorBoundary extends React.Component {
      constructor(props) {
        super(props);
        this.state = { hasError: false };
      }

      static getDerivedStateFromError(error) {
        // Update state so the next render will show the fallback UI.
        return { hasError: true };
      }

      render() {
        if (this.state.hasError) {
          // You can render any custom fallback UI
          return <h1>Something went wrong.</h1>;
        }

        return this.props.children;
      }
    }
    ```

66. ### What is the methods order when component re-rendered?

    An update can be caused by changes to props or state. The below methods are called in the following order when a component is being re-rendered.

    1.  static getDerivedStateFromProps()
    2.  shouldComponentUpdate()
    3.  render()
    4.  getSnapshotBeforeUpdate()
    5.  componentDidUpdate()

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

67. ### What are the methods invoked during error handling?

    Below methods are called when there is an error during rendering, in a lifecycle method, or in the constructor of any child component.

    1.  static getDerivedStateFromError()
    2.  componentDidCatch()

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

68. ### What is the purpose of unmountComponentAtNode method?

    This method is available from react-dom package and it removes a mounted React component from the DOM and clean up its event handlers and state. If no component was mounted in the container, calling this function does nothing. Returns true if a component was unmounted and false if there was no component to unmount.

    The method signature would be as follows,

    ```javascript
    ReactDOM.unmountComponentAtNode(container);
    ```

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

69. ### What are the limitations with HOCs?

    Higher-order components come with a few caveats apart from its benefits. Below are the few listed in an order,

    1.  **Don’t use HOCs inside the render method:**
        It is not recommended to apply a HOC to a component within the render method of a component.

        ```javascript
        render() {
          // A new version of EnhancedComponent is created on every render
          // EnhancedComponent1 !== EnhancedComponent2
          const EnhancedComponent = enhance(MyComponent);
          // That causes the entire subtree to unmount/remount each time!
          return <EnhancedComponent />;
        }
        ```

        The above code impacts on performance by remounting a component that causes the state of that component and all of its children to be lost. Instead, apply HOCs outside the component definition so that the resulting component is created only once.

    2.  **Static methods must be copied over:**
        When you apply a HOC to a component the new component does not have any of the static methods of the original component

        ```javascript
        // Define a static method
        WrappedComponent.staticMethod = function () {
          /*...*/
        };
        // Now apply a HOC
        const EnhancedComponent = enhance(WrappedComponent);

        // The enhanced component has no static method
        typeof EnhancedComponent.staticMethod === "undefined"; // true
        ```

        You can overcome this by copying the methods onto the container before returning it,

        ```javascript
        function enhance(WrappedComponent) {
          class Enhance extends React.Component {
            /*...*/
          }
          // Must know exactly which method(s) to copy :(
          Enhance.staticMethod = WrappedComponent.staticMethod;
          return Enhance;
        }
        ```

    3.  **Refs aren’t passed through:**
        For HOCs you need to pass through all props to the wrapped component but this does not work for refs. This is because ref is not really a prop similar to key. In this case you need to use the React.forwardRef API

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

70. ### How to debug forwardRefs in DevTools?

    **React.forwardRef** accepts a render function as parameter and DevTools uses this function to determine what to display for the ref forwarding component.

    For example, If you don't name the render function or not using displayName property then it will appear as ”ForwardRef” in the DevTools,

    ```javascript
    const WrappedComponent = React.forwardRef((props, ref) => {
      return <LogProps {...props} forwardedRef={ref} />;
    });
    ```

    But If you name the render function then it will appear as **”ForwardRef(myFunction)”**

    ```javascript
    const WrappedComponent = React.forwardRef(function myFunction(props, ref) {
      return <LogProps {...props} forwardedRef={ref} />;
    });
    ```

    As an alternative, You can also set displayName property for forwardRef function,

    ```javascript
    function logProps(Component) {
      class LogProps extends React.Component {
        // ...
      }

      function forwardRef(props, ref) {
        return <LogProps {...props} forwardedRef={ref} />;
      }

      // Give this component a more helpful display name in DevTools.
      // e.g. "ForwardRef(logProps(MyComponent))"
      const name = Component.displayName || Component.name;
      forwardRef.displayName = `logProps(${name})`;

      return React.forwardRef(forwardRef);
    }
    ```

71. ### Is it good to use arrow functions in render methods?

    Yes, You can use. It is often the easiest way to pass parameters to callback functions. But you need to optimize the performance while using it.

    ```javascript
    class Foo extends Component {
      handleClick() {
        console.log("Click happened");
      }
      render() {
        return <button onClick={() => this.handleClick()}>Click Me</button>;
      }
    }
    ```

    **Note:** Using an arrow function in render method creates a new function each time the component renders, which may have performance implications

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

72. ### How do you say that state updates are merged?

    When you call setState() in the component, React merges the object you provide into the current state.

    For example, let us take a facebook user with posts and comments details as state variables,

    ```javascript
      constructor(props) {
        super(props);
        this.state = {
          posts: [],
          comments: []
        };
      }
    ```

    Now you can update them independently with separate `setState()` calls as below,

    ```javascript
     componentDidMount() {
        fetchPosts().then(response => {
          this.setState({
            posts: response.posts
          });
        });

        fetchComments().then(response => {
          this.setState({
            comments: response.comments
          });
        });
      }
    ```

    As mentioned in the above code snippets, `this.setState({comments})` updates only comments variable without modifying or replacing `posts` variable.

73. ### How do you pass arguments to an event handler?

    During iterations or loops, it is common to pass an extra parameter to an event handler. This can be achieved through arrow functions or bind method.

    Let us take an example of user details updated in a grid,

    ```javascript
    <button onClick={(e) => this.updateUser(userId, e)}>Update User details</button>
    <button onClick={this.updateUser.bind(this, userId)}>Update User details</button>
    ```

    In the both approaches, the synthetic argument `e` is passed as a second argument. You need to pass it explicitly for arrow functions and it will be passed automatically for `bind` method.

74. ### How to prevent component from rendering?

    You can prevent component from rendering by returning null based on specific condition. This way it can conditionally render component.

    ```javascript
    function Greeting(props) {
      if (!props.loggedIn) {
        return null;
      }

      return <div className="greeting">welcome, {props.name}</div>;
    }
    ```

    ```javascript
    class User extends React.Component {
      constructor(props) {
        super(props);
        this.state = {loggedIn: false, name: 'John'};
      }

      render() {
       return (
           <div>
             //Prevent component render if it is not loggedIn
             <Greeting loggedIn={this.state.loggedIn} />
             <UserDetails name={this.state.name}>
           </div>
       );
      }
    ```

    In the above example, the `greeting` component skips its rendering section by applying condition and returning null value.

75. ### Give an example on How to use context?

    **Context** is designed to share data that can be considered **global** for a tree of React components.

    For example, in the code below lets manually thread through a “theme” prop in order to style the Button component.

    ```javascript
    //Lets create a context with a default theme value "luna"
    const ThemeContext = React.createContext("luna");
    // Create App component where it uses provider to pass theme value in the tree
    class App extends React.Component {
      render() {
        return (
          <ThemeContext.Provider value="nova">
            <Toolbar />
          </ThemeContext.Provider>
        );
      }
    }
    // A middle component where you don't need to pass theme prop anymore
    function Toolbar(props) {
      return (
        <div>
          <ThemedButton />
        </div>
      );
    }
    // Lets read theme value in the button component to use
    class ThemedButton extends React.Component {
      static contextType = ThemeContext;
      render() {
        return <Button theme={this.context} />;
      }
    }
    ```

76. ### How do you use contextType?

    ContextType is used to consume the context object. The contextType property can be used in two ways,

    1.  **contextType as property of class:**
        The contextType property on a class can be assigned a Context object created by React.createContext(). After that, you can consume the nearest current value of that Context type using this.context in any of the lifecycle methods and render function.

        Lets assign contextType property on MyClass as below,

        ```javascript
        class MyClass extends React.Component {
          componentDidMount() {
            let value = this.context;
            /* perform a side-effect at mount using the value of MyContext */
          }
          componentDidUpdate() {
            let value = this.context;
            /* ... */
          }
          componentWillUnmount() {
            let value = this.context;
            /* ... */
          }
          render() {
            let value = this.context;
            /* render something based on the value of MyContext */
          }
        }
        MyClass.contextType = MyContext;
        ```

    2.  **Static field**
        You can use a static class field to initialize your contextType using public class field syntax.

        ```javascript
        class MyClass extends React.Component {
          static contextType = MyContext;
          render() {
            let value = this.context;
            /* render something based on the value */
          }
        }
        ```

77. ### What is a consumer?

    A Consumer is a React component that subscribes to context changes. It requires a function as a child which receives current context value as argument and returns a react node. The value argument passed to the function will be equal to the value prop of the closest Provider for this context above in the tree.

    Lets take a simple example,

    ```javascript
    <MyContext.Consumer>
      {value => /* render something based on the context value */}
    </MyContext.Consumer>
    ```

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

78. ### How do you solve performance corner cases while using context?

    The context uses reference identity to determine when to re-render, there are some gotchas that could trigger unintentional renders in consumers when a provider’s parent re-renders.

    For example, the code below will re-render all consumers every time the Provider re-renders because a new object is always created for value.

    ```javascript
    class App extends React.Component {
      render() {
        return (
          <Provider value={{ something: "something" }}>
            <Toolbar />
          </Provider>
        );
      }
    }
    ```

    This can be solved by lifting up the value to parent state,

    ```javascript
    class App extends React.Component {
      constructor(props) {
        super(props);
        this.state = {
          value: { something: "something" },
        };
      }

      render() {
        return (
          <Provider value={this.state.value}>
            <Toolbar />
          </Provider>
        );
      }
    }
    ```

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

79. ### What is the purpose of forward ref in HOCs?

    Refs will not get passed through because ref is not a prop. It is handled differently by React just like **key**. If you add a ref to a HOC, the ref will refer to the outermost container component, not the wrapped component. In this case, you can use Forward Ref API. For example, we can explicitly forward refs to the inner FancyButton component using the React.forwardRef API.

    The below HOC logs all props,

    ```javascript
    function logProps(Component) {
      class LogProps extends React.Component {
        componentDidUpdate(prevProps) {
          console.log("old props:", prevProps);
          console.log("new props:", this.props);
        }

        render() {
          const { forwardedRef, ...rest } = this.props;

          // Assign the custom prop "forwardedRef" as a ref
          return <Component ref={forwardedRef} {...rest} />;
        }
      }

      return React.forwardRef((props, ref) => {
        return <LogProps {...props} forwardedRef={ref} />;
      });
    }
    ```

    Let's use this HOC to log all props that get passed to our “fancy button” component,

    ```javascript
    class FancyButton extends React.Component {
      focus() {
        // ...
      }

      // ...
    }
    export default logProps(FancyButton);
    ```

    Now let's create a ref and pass it to FancyButton component. In this case, you can set focus to button element.

    ```javascript
    import FancyButton from "./FancyButton";

    const ref = React.createRef();
    ref.current.focus();
    <FancyButton label="Click Me" handleClick={handleClick} ref={ref} />;
    ```

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

80. ### Is ref argument available for all functions or class components?
    Regular function or class components don’t receive the ref argument, and ref is not available in props either. The second ref argument only exists when you define a component with React.forwardRef call.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

81. ### Why do you need additional care for component libraries while using forward refs?
    When you start using forwardRef in a component library, you should treat it as a breaking change and release a new major version of your library. This is because your library likely has a different behavior such as what refs get assigned to, and what types are exported. These changes can break apps and other libraries that depend on the old behavior.

82. ### How to create react class components without ES6?

    If you don’t use ES6 then you may need to use the create-react-class module instead. For default props, you need to define getDefaultProps() as a function on the passed object. Whereas for initial state, you have to provide a separate getInitialState method that returns the initial state.

    ```javascript
    var Greeting = createReactClass({
      getDefaultProps: function () {
        return {
          name: "Jhohn",
        };
      },
      getInitialState: function () {
        return { message: this.props.message };
      },
      handleClick: function () {
        console.log(this.state.message);
      },
      render: function () {
        return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}</h1>;
      },
    });
    ```

    **Note:** If you use createReactClass then auto binding is available for all methods. i.e, You don't need to use `.bind(this)` with in constructor for event handlers.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

83. ### Is it possible to use react without JSX?

    Yes, JSX is not mandatory for using React. Actually it is convenient when you don’t want to set up compilation in your build environment. Each JSX element is just syntactic sugar for calling `React.createElement(component, props, ...children)`.

    For example, let us take a greeting example with JSX,

    ```javascript
    class Greeting extends React.Component {
      render() {
        return <div>Hello {this.props.message}</div>;
      }
    }

    ReactDOM.render(
      <Greeting message="World" />,
      document.getElementById("root")
    );
    ```

    You can write the same code without JSX as below,

    ```javascript
    class Greeting extends React.Component {
      render() {
        return React.createElement("div", null, `Hello ${this.props.message}`);
      }
    }

    ReactDOM.render(
      React.createElement(Greeting, { message: "World" }, null),
      document.getElementById("root")
    );
    ```

84. ### How do you create HOC using render props?

    You can implement most higher-order components (HOC) using a regular component with a render prop. For example, if you would prefer to have a withMouse HOC instead of a <Mouse> component, you could easily create one using a regular <Mouse> with a render prop.

    ```javascript
    function withMouse(Component) {
      return class extends React.Component {
        render() {
          return (
            <Mouse
              render={(mouse) => <Component {...this.props} mouse={mouse} />}
            />
          );
        }
      };
    }
    ```

    This way render props gives the flexibility of using either pattern.

88. ### How do you get redux scaffolding using create-react-app?
    Redux team has provided official redux+js or redux+typescript templates for create-react-app project. The generated project setup includes,
    1.  Redux Toolkit and React-Redux dependencies
    2.  Create and configure Redux store
    3.  React-Redux `<Provider>` passing the store to React components
    4.  Small "counter" example to demo how to add redux logic and React-Redux hooks API to interact with the store from components
        The below commands need to be executed along with template option as below,
    5.  **Javascript template:**
    ```js
    npx create-react-app my-app --template redux
    ```
    2.  **Typescript template:**
    ```js
    npx create-react-app my-app --template redux-typescript
    ```

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

89. ### What is state mutation and how to prevent it?

    `State mutation` happens when you try to update the state of a component without actually using `setState` function. This can happen when you are trying to do some computations using a state variable and unknowingly save the result in the same state variable. This is the main reason why it is advised to return new instances of state variables from the reducers by using Object.assign({}, ...) or spread syntax.

    This can cause unknown issues in the UI as the value of the state variable got updated without telling React to check what all components were being affected from this update and it can cause UI bugs.

    Ex:

    ```javascript
    class A extends React.component {
      constructor(props) {
        super(props);
        this.state = {
          loading: false
        }
     }

    componentDidMount() {
      let { loading } = this.state;
      loading = (() => true)(); // Trying to perform an operation and directly saving in a state variable
    }

    ```

    **How to prevent it:** Make sure your state variables are immutable by either enforcing immutability by using plugins like Immutable.js, always using `setState` to make updates, and returning new instances in reducers when sending updated state values.

1. ### What are the possible ways to create objects in JavaScript

    There are many ways to create objects in javascript as mentioned below:

    1. **Object literal syntax:**

       The object literal syntax (or object initializer), is a comma-separated set of name-value pairs wrapped in curly braces.

       ```javascript
       var object = {
         name: "Sudheer",
         age: 34,
       };
       ```

       Object literal property values can be of any data type, including array, function, and nested object.

       **Note:** This is one of the easiest ways to create an object and it's most commonly used for creating simple, ad-hoc objects.

    2. **Object constructor:**

       The simplest way to create an empty object is using the `Object` constructor. Currently this approach is not recommended.

       ```javascript
       var object = new Object();
       ```

       The `Object()` is a built-in constructor function so "new" keyword is not required for creating plain objects. The above code snippet can be re-written as:

       ```javascript
       var object = Object();
       ```
       However, `Object()` can be used to either create a plain object or convert a given value into its corresponding object wrapper, whereas `new Object()` is specifically used to explicitly create a new object instance.
       
    3. **Object's create method:**

       The `create` method of Object is used to create a new object by passing the specified prototype object and properties as arguments, i.e., this pattern is helpful to create new objects based on existing objects. In other words, this is useful for setting up **prototypal inheritance**. The second argument is optional and it is used to create properties on a newly created object.

       The following code creates a new empty object whose prototype is null.

       ```javascript
       var object = Object.create(null);
       ```

       The following example creates an object along with additional new properties.

       ```javascript
       let vehicle = {
         wheels: "4",
         fuelType: "Gasoline",
         color: "Green",
       };
       let carProps = {
         type: {
           value: "Volkswagen",
         },
         model: {
           value: "Golf",
         },
       };

       var car = Object.create(vehicle, carProps);
       console.log(car);
       ```

    4. **Function constructor:**

       In this approach, create any function and apply the new operator to create object instances. This was the main way to do constructor-based OOP before ES6 classes.

       ```javascript
       function Person(name) {
         this.name = name;
         this.age = 21;
       }
       var object = new Person("Sudheer");
       ```
    5. **Function constructor with prototype:**

       This is similar to function constructor but it uses prototype for their properties and methods. Using prototype means you're sharing methods/properties across instances, which saves memory and improve performance.

       ```javascript
       function Person() {}
       Person.prototype.name = "Sudheer";
       var object = new Person();
       ```

       This is equivalent to creating an instance with `Object.create` method with a function prototype and then calling that function with an instance and parameters as arguments.

       ```javascript
       function func(x, y, z) {
        this.x = x;
        this.y = y;
        this.z = z;
       }

       var instance = new func(1, 2, 3);
       ```

       **(OR)**

       ```javascript
       function func(x, y, z) {
          this.x = x;
          this.y = y;
          this.z = z;
       }
       // Create a new instance using function prototype.
       var newInstance = Object.create(func.prototype);

       // Call the function
       var result = func.call(newInstance, 1, 2, 3);

       // If the result is a non-null object then use it otherwise just use the new instance.
       console.log(result && typeof result === 'object' ? result : newInstance);
       ```

    6. **Object's assign method:**

       The `Object.assign` method is used to copy all the properties from one or more source objects and stores them into a target object. This is mainly used for cloning and merging

       The following code creates a new staff object by copying properties of his working company and the car he owns.

       ```javascript
       const orgObject = { company: "XYZ Corp" };
       const carObject = { name: "Toyota" };
       const staff = Object.assign({}, orgObject, carObject);
       ```

    7. **ES6 Class syntax:**

       ES6 introduces class feature to create objects. This is syntactic sugar over the prototype-based system.

       ```javascript
       class Person {
         constructor(name) {
           this.name = name;
         }
       }

       var object = new Person("Sudheer");
       ```

    8. **Singleton pattern:**

       A Singleton is an object which can only be instantiated one time. Repeated calls to its constructor return the same instance. This way one can ensure that they don't accidentally create multiple instances.

        ##### Singleton with Closure (Classic JS Pattern)
        ```javascript
        const Singleton = (function () {
        let instance;

        function createInstance() {
          return { name: "Sudheer" };
        }

        return {
          getInstance: function () {
            if (!instance) {
              instance = createInstance();
            }
            return instance;
          }
        };
        })();

        // Usage
        const obj1 = Singleton.getInstance();
        const obj2 = Singleton.getInstance();

        console.log(obj1 === obj2); // true
        ```
         In modern JavaScript applications, singletons are commonly implemented using ES6 modules for their built-in caching behavior, or closures for encapsulated state management.

2. ### What is a prototype chain

    The prototype chain is a core concept in JavaScript’s inheritance model. It allows objects to inherit properties and methods from other objects. When you try to access a property or method on an object, JavaScript first looks for it on that object itself. If it’s not found, the engine looks up the object's internal `[[Prototype]]` reference (accessible via `Object.getPrototypeOf(obj)` or the deprecated `__proto__` property) and continues searching up the chain until it finds the property or reaches the end (usually `null`).

    For objects created via constructor functions, the prototype chain starts with the instance, then refers to the constructor’s `.prototype` object, and continues from there. For example:

    ```javascript
    function Person() {}
    const person1 = new Person();

    console.log(Object.getPrototypeOf(person1) === Person.prototype); // true
    ```

    This mechanism allows for property and method sharing among objects, enabling code reuse and a form of inheritance.

    **Summary:**

    *   The prototype chain enables inheritance in JavaScript.
    *   If a property isn’t found on an object, JavaScript looks up its prototype chain.
    *   The prototype of an object instance can be accessed with `Object.getPrototypeOf(obj)` or `__proto__`.
    *   The prototype of a constructor function is available via `Constructor.prototype`.
    *   The chain ends when the prototype is `null`.

    The prototype chain among objects appears as below,

3. ### What is the Difference Between `call`, `apply`, and `bind`

  In JavaScript, `call`, `apply`, and `bind` are methods that allow you to control the context (`this` value) in which a function is executed. While their purposes are similar, they differ in how they handle arguments and when the function is invoked.

  ---

  #### `call`

  - **Description:**  
    The `call()` method invokes a function immediately, allowing you to specify the value of `this` and pass arguments individually (comma-separated).

  - **Syntax:**  
    ```js
    func.call(thisArg, arg1, arg2, ...)
    ```

  - **Example:**
    ```js
    var employee1 = { firstName: "John", lastName: "Rodson" };
    var employee2 = { firstName: "Jimmy", lastName: "Baily" };

    function invite(greeting1, greeting2) {
      console.log(
        greeting1 + " " + this.firstName + " " + this.lastName + ", " + greeting2
      );
    }

    invite.call(employee1, "Hello", "How are you?"); // Hello John Rodson, How are you?
    invite.call(employee2, "Hello", "How are you?"); // Hello Jimmy Baily, How are you?
    ```

  #### `apply`

  - **Description:**  
    The `apply()` method is similar to `call()`, but it takes the function arguments as an array (or array-like object) instead of individual arguments.

  - **Syntax:**  
    ```js
    func.apply(thisArg, [argsArray])
    ```

  - **Example:**
    ```js
    var employee1 = { firstName: "John", lastName: "Rodson" };
    var employee2 = { firstName: "Jimmy", lastName: "Baily" };

    function invite(greeting1, greeting2) {
      console.log(
        greeting1 + " " + this.firstName + " " + this.lastName + ", " + greeting2
      );
    }

    invite.apply(employee1, ["Hello", "How are you?"]); // Hello John Rodson, How are you?
    invite.apply(employee2, ["Hello", "How are you?"]); // Hello Jimmy Baily, How are you?
    ```

  ---

  #### `bind`

  - **Description:**  
    The `bind()` method creates a new function with a specific `this` value and, optionally, preset initial arguments. Unlike `call` and `apply`, `bind` does **not** immediately invoke the function; instead, it returns a new function that you can call later.

  - **Syntax:**  
    ```js
    var boundFunc = func.bind(thisArg[, arg1[, arg2[, ...]]])
    ```

  - **Example:**
    ```js
    var employee1 = { firstName: "John", lastName: "Rodson" };
    var employee2 = { firstName: "Jimmy", lastName: "Baily" };

    function invite(greeting1, greeting2) {
      console.log(
        greeting1 + " " + this.firstName + " " + this.lastName + ", " + greeting2
      );
    }

    var inviteEmployee1 = invite.bind(employee1);
    var inviteEmployee2 = invite.bind(employee2);

    inviteEmployee1("Hello", "How are you?"); // Hello John Rodson, How are you?
    inviteEmployee2("Hello", "How are you?"); // Hello Jimmy Baily, How are you?
    ```

  ---

  #### Summary

  | Method | Invokes Function Immediately? | How Arguments Are Passed         | Returns      |
  |--------|-------------------------------|----------------------------------|--------------|
  | `call` | Yes                           | Comma-separated list             | Function's result |
  | `apply`| Yes                           | Array or array-like object       | Function's result |
  | `bind` | No                            | (Optional) preset, then rest     | New function      |

  ---

  ## Key Points

  - **`call`** and **`apply`** are almost interchangeable; both invoke the function immediately, but differ in how arguments are passed.
      - _Tip:_ "Call is for Comma-separated, Apply is for Array."
  - **`bind`** does not execute the function immediately. Instead, it creates a new function with the specified `this` value and optional arguments, which can be called later.

  - Use `call` or `apply` when you want to immediately invoke a function with a specific `this` context. Use `bind` when you want to create a new function with a specific `this` context to be invoked later.

4. ### What is JSON and its common operations

    **JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)** is a lightweight, text-based data format that uses JavaScript object syntax for structuring data. It was popularized by Douglas Crockford and is widely used for transmitting data between a server and a client in web applications. JSON files typically have a `.json` extension and use the MIME type `application/json`. 

    #### Common Operations with JSON

    1. **Parsing**: Transforming a JSON-formatted string into a native JavaScript object.
      ```js
      const obj = JSON.parse(jsonString);
      ```
      - Example:  
        ```js
        const jsonString = '{"name":"John","age":30}';
        const obj = JSON.parse(jsonString);  // { name: "John", age: 30 }
        ```

    2. **Stringification**: Converting a JavaScript object into a JSON-formatted string, commonly used for data transmission or storage.
      ```js
      const jsonString = JSON.stringify(object);
      ```
      - Example:  
        ```js
        const obj = { name: "Jane", age: 25 };
        const jsonString = JSON.stringify(obj);  // '{"name":"Jane","age":25}'
        ```

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

5. ### What is the purpose of the array slice method

    The `slice()` method in JavaScript is used to extract a section of an array, returning a new array containing the selected elements. It does not modify the original array. The method takes two arguments:

    - **start**: The index at which extraction begins (inclusive).
    - **end** (optional): The index before which to end extraction (exclusive). If omitted, extraction continues to the end of the array.

    You can also use negative indices, which count from the end of the array.

    #### Examples:

    ```js
    let arrayIntegers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

    let arrayIntegers1 = arrayIntegers.slice(0, 2);    // [1, 2]
    let arrayIntegers2 = arrayIntegers.slice(2, 3);    // [3]
    let arrayIntegers3 = arrayIntegers.slice(4);       // [5]
    let arrayIntegers4 = arrayIntegers.slice(-3, -1);  // [3, 4]
    ```

    **Note:**  
    The `slice()` method does **not** mutate (change) the original array; instead, it returns a new array containing the extracted elements.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

6. ### What is the purpose of the array splice method

    The `splice()` method in JavaScript is used to add, remove, or replace elements within an array. Unlike `slice()`, which creates a shallow copy and does not alter the original array, `splice()` **modifies the original array in place** and returns an array containing the removed elements.

    #### Syntax

    ```javascript
    array.splice(start, deleteCount, item1, item2, ...)
    ```
    - **start:** The index at which to start changing the array.
    - **deleteCount:** (Optional) The number of elements to remove from the array. If omitted, all elements from the start index to the end of the array will be removed.
    - **item1, item2, ...:** (Optional) Elements to add to the array, starting at the start position.

    #### Examples

    ```javascript
    let arrayIntegersOriginal1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    let arrayIntegersOriginal2 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    let arrayIntegersOriginal3 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

    // Remove the first two elements
    let arrayIntegers1 = arrayIntegersOriginal1.splice(0, 2); 
    // arrayIntegers1: [1, 2]
    // arrayIntegersOriginal1 (after): [3, 4, 5]

    // Remove all elements from index 3 onwards
    let arrayIntegers2 = arrayIntegersOriginal2.splice(3);     
    // arrayIntegers2: [4, 5]
    // arrayIntegersOriginal2 (after): [1, 2, 3]

    // Remove 1 element at index 3, then insert "a", "b", "c" at that position
    let arrayIntegers3 = arrayIntegersOriginal3.splice(3, 1, "a", "b", "c"); 
    // arrayIntegers3: [4]
    // arrayIntegersOriginal3 (after): [1, 2, 3, "a", "b", "c", 5]
    ```

    **Note:**  
    - The `splice()` method **modifies the original array**.
    - It returns an array containing the elements that were removed (if any).
    - You can use it both to remove and insert elements in a single operation.

7. ### What is the difference between slice and splice
   
    Here are the key differences between `slice()` and `splice()` methods in JavaScript arrays:

    | `slice()`                                         | `splice()`                                          |
    | ------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
    | Does **not** modify the original array (immutable) | Modifies the original array (mutable)               |
    | Returns a **shallow copy** (subset) of selected elements | Returns an array of the **removed** elements           |
    | Used to **extract** elements from an array         | Used to **add**, **remove**, or **replace** elements in an array |
    | Syntax: `array.slice(start, end)`                  | Syntax: `array.splice(start, deleteCount, ...items)`             |

    **Summary:**  
    - Use `slice()` when you want to copy or extract elements without altering the original array.
    - Use `splice()` when you need to add, remove, or replace elements and want to change the original array.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

8. ### How do you compare Object and Map

    **Objects** and **Maps** both allow you to associate keys with values, retrieve those values, delete keys, and check if a key exists. Historically, Objects have been used as Maps, but there are several key differences that make `Map` a better choice in certain scenarios:

    | Feature                  | Object                                              | Map                                                      |
    |--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
    | **Key Types**            | Only strings and symbols are valid keys             | Any value can be used as a key (objects, functions, primitives) |
    | **Key Order**            | Keys are unordered (in practice, insertion order is mostly preserved for string keys, but not guaranteed) | Keys are ordered by insertion; iteration follows insertion order |
    | **Size Property**        | No built-in way to get the number of keys; must use `Object.keys(obj).length` | Use the `.size` property for the number of entries        |
    | **Iterability**          | Not directly iterable; must use `Object.keys`, `Object.values`, or `Object.entries` | Directly iterable with `for...of`, `.keys()`, `.values()`, `.entries()` |
    | **Prototype**            | Has a prototype chain; may have default properties that can collide with custom keys (can be avoided with `Object.create(null)`) | Does not have a prototype, so there are no default keys   |
    | **Performance**          | May be less efficient for frequent additions/removals | Optimized for frequent additions and deletions            |
    | **Serialization**        | Can be easily serialized to JSON                    | Cannot be directly serialized to JSON                     |

9. ### What is the difference between == and === operators
    JavaScript provides two types of equality operators:

    - **Loose equality (`==`, `!=`)**: Performs type conversion if the types differ, comparing values after converting them to a common type.
    - **Strict equality (`===`, `!==`)**: Compares both value and type, without any type conversion.

    #### Strict Equality (`===`)
    - Two strings are strictly equal if they have exactly the same sequence of characters and length.
    - Two numbers are strictly equal if they have the same numeric value.
      - **Special cases:**
        - `NaN === NaN` is `false`
        - `+0 === -0` is `true`
    - Two booleans are strictly equal if both are `true` or both are `false`.
    - Two objects are strictly equal if they refer to the **same object** in memory.
    - `null` and `undefined` are **not** strictly equal.

    #### Loose Equality (`==`)
    - Converts operands to the same type before making the comparison.
    - `null == undefined` is `true`.
    - `"1" == 1` is `true` because the string is converted to a number.
    - `0 == false` is `true` because `false` is converted to `0`.

    #### Examples:

    ```javascript
    0 == false            // true      (loose equality, type coercion)
    0 === false           // false     (strict equality, different types)
    1 == "1"              // true      (string converted to number)
    1 === "1"             // false     (different types)
    null == undefined     // true      (special case)
    null === undefined    // false     (different types)
    '0' == false          // true      ('0' is converted to 0)
    '0' === false         // false     (different types)
    NaN == NaN            // false     (NaN is never equal to itself)
    NaN === NaN           // false
    [] == []              // false     (different array objects)
    [] === []             // false
    {} == {}              // false     (different object references)
    {} === {}             // false
    ```

10. ### What are lambda expressions or arrow functions

    **Arrow functions** (also known as "lambda expressions") provide a concise syntax for writing function expressions in JavaScript. Introduced in ES6, arrow functions are often shorter and more readable, especially for simple operations or callbacks.

    #### Key Features:
    - Arrow functions do **not** have their own `this`, `arguments`, `super`, or `new.target` bindings. They inherit these from their surrounding (lexical) context.
    - They are best suited for non-method functions, such as callbacks or simple computations.
    - Arrow functions **cannot** be used as constructors and do not have a `prototype` property.
    - They also cannot be used with `new`, `yield`, or as generator functions.

    #### Syntax Examples:

    ```javascript
    const arrowFunc1 = (a, b) => a + b;    // Multiple parameters, returns a + b
    const arrowFunc2 = a => a * 10;        // Single parameter (parentheses optional), returns a * 10
    const arrowFunc3 = () => {};           // No parameters, returns undefined
    const arrowFunc4 = (a, b) => {
      // Multiple statements require curly braces and explicit return
      const sum = a + b;
      return sum * 2;
    };
    ```

11. ### What is a first class function

    In JavaScript, **first-class functions(first-class citizens)** mean that functions are treated like any other variable. That means:

    1. You can assign a function to a variable.
    2. You can pass a function as an argument to another function.
    3. You can return a function from another function.

    This capability enables powerful patterns like callbacks, higher-order functions, event handling, and functional programming in JavaScript.
    
    For example, the handler function below is assigned to a variable and then passed as an argument to the `addEventListener` method.

    ```javascript
    const handler = () => console.log("This is a click handler function");
    document.addEventListener("click", handler);
    ```

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

12. ### What is a first order function

    A first-order function is a function that doesn’t accept another function as an argument and doesn’t return a function as its return value. i.e,  It's a regular function that works with primitive or non-function values.

    ```javascript
    const firstOrder = () => console.log("I am a first order function!");
    ```

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

13. ### What is a higher order function

    A higher-order function is a function that either accepts another function as an argument, returns a function as its result, or both. This concept is a core part of JavaScript's functional programming capabilities and is widely used for creating modular, reusable, and expressive code.

    The syntactic structure of higher order function will be explained with an example as follows,

      ```javascript
      // First-order function (does not accept or return another function)
      const firstOrderFunc = () => 
        console.log("Hello, I am a first-order function");

      // Higher-order function (accepts a function as an argument)
      const higherOrder = (callback) => callback();

      // Passing the first-order function to the higher-order function
      higherOrder(firstOrderFunc);
      ```

    In this example:

    1. `firstOrderFunc` is a regular (first-order) function.

    2. `higherOrder` is a higher-order function because it takes another function as an argument.

    3. `firstOrderFunc` is also called a **callback function** because it is passed to and executed by another function.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

14. ### What is a unary function

    A unary function (also known as a **monadic** function) is a function that **accepts exactly one argument**. The term "unary" simply refers to the function's arity—the number of arguments it takes.

    Let us take an example of unary function,

    ```javascript
    const unaryFunction = (a) => console.log(a + 10); // This will add 10 to the input and log the result
    unaryFunction(5); // Output: 15
    ```
    In this example:

    - `unaryFunction` takes a single parameter `a`, making it a unary function.
    - It performs a simple operation: adding 10 to the input and printing the result.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

15. ### What is the currying function
    
    **Currying** is the process of transforming a function with **multiple arguments** into a sequence of **nested functions**, each accepting **only one argument** at a time.

    This concept is named after mathematician **Haskell Curry**, and is commonly used in functional programming to enhance modularity and reuse.


    ## Before Currying (Normal n-ary Function)

    ```javascript
    const multiArgFunction = (a, b, c) => a + b + c;

    console.log(multiArgFunction(1, 2, 3)); // Output: 6
    ```
    This is a standard function that takes three arguments at once.

    ## After Currying (Unary Function Chain)
    ```javascript
    const curryUnaryFunction = (a) => (b) => (c) => a + b + c;

    console.log(curryUnaryFunction(1));       // Returns: function (b) => ...
    console.log(curryUnaryFunction(1)(2));    // Returns: function (c) => ...
    console.log(curryUnaryFunction(1)(2)(3)); // Output: 6

    ```
    Each function in the chain accepts one argument and returns the next function, until all arguments are provided and the final result is computed.

    ## Benefits of Currying
      - Improves code reusability
      → You can partially apply functions with known arguments.

      - Enhances functional composition
      → Easier to compose small, pure functions.

      - Encourages clean, modular code
      → You can split logic into smaller single-responsibility functions.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

16. ### What is a pure function

    A **pure function** is a function whose output depends only on its input arguments and produces no side effects. This means that given the same inputs, a pure function will always return the same output, and it does not modify any external state or data.

    Let's take an example to see the difference between pure and impure functions,

    #### Example: Pure vs. Impure Functions

    ```javascript
    // Impure Function
    let numberArray = [];
    const impureAddNumber = (number) => numberArray.push(number);

    // Pure Function
    const pureAddNumber = (number) => (inputArray) =>
      inputArray.concat([number]);

    // Usage
    console.log(impureAddNumber(6)); // returns 1
    console.log(numberArray);        // returns [6]

    console.log(pureAddNumber(7)(numberArray)); // returns [6, 7]
    console.log(numberArray);                   // remains [6]
    ```
    - `impureAddNumber` changes the external variable numberArray and returns the new length of the array, making it impure.
    - `pureAddNumber` creates a new array with the added number and does not modify the original array, making it pure.

17. ### What are the benefits of pure functions
    Some of the major benefits of pure functions are listed below,

    - **Easier testing:** Since output depends only on input, pure functions are simple to test.
    - **Predictability:** No hidden side effects make behavior easier to reason about.
    - **Immutability:** Pure functions align with ES6 best practices, such as preferring const over let, supporting safer and more maintainable code.
    - **No side effects:** Reduces bugs related to shared state or mutation.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

18. ### What is the purpose of the let keyword

    The `let` keyword in JavaScript is used to declare a **block-scoped local variable**. This means that variables declared with `let` are only accessible within the block, statement, or expression where they are defined. This is a significant improvement over the older `var` keyword, which is function-scoped (or globally-scoped if declared outside a function), and does not respect block-level scoping.

    #### Key Features of `let`:
    - **Block Scope:** The variable exists only within the nearest enclosing block (e.g., inside an `{}` pair).
    - **No Hoisting Issues:** While `let` declarations are hoisted, they are not initialized until the code defining them is executed. Accessing them before declaration results in a ReferenceError (temporal dead zone).
    - **No Redeclaration:** The same variable cannot be declared twice in the same scope with `let`.

    #### Example:

    ```javascript
    let counter = 30;
    if (counter === 30) {
      let counter = 31;
      console.log(counter); // Output: 31 (block-scoped variable inside if-block)
    }
    console.log(counter); // Output: 30 (outer variable, unaffected by inner block)
    ```

    In this example, the `counter` inside the `if` block is a separate variable from the one outside. The `let` keyword ensures that both have their own distinct scope.

    In summary, you need to use `let` when you want variables to be limited to the block in which they are defined, preventing accidental overwrites and bugs related to variable scope.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

19. ### What is the difference between let and var

    You can list out the differences in a tabular format

    | var                                                            | let                                           |
    | -------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
    | It has been available from the beginning of JavaScript         | Introduced as part of ES6                     |
    | It has function scope                                          | It has block scope                            |
    | Variable declaration will be hoisted, initialized as undefined | Hoisted but not initialized                   |
    | It is possible to re-declare the variable in the same scope    | It is not possible to re-declare the variable |

    Let's take an example to see the difference,

    ```javascript
    function userDetails(username) {
      if (username) {
        console.log(salary); // undefined due to hoisting
        console.log(age); // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'age' before initialization
        let age = 30;
        var salary = 10000;
      }
      console.log(salary); //10000 (accessible due to function scope)
      console.log(age); //error: age is not defined(due to block scope)
    }
    userDetails("John");
    ```

20. ### What is the reason to choose the name let as a keyword

    The keyword `let` was chosen because it originates from mathematical notation, where "let" is used to introduce new variables (for example, "let x = 5"). This term was adopted by several early programming languages such as Scheme and BASIC, establishing a tradition in computer science. JavaScript follows this convention by using `let` to declare variables with block scope, providing a modern alternative to `var`. The choice helps make the language more familiar to programmers coming from other languages and aligns with the mathematical practice of variable assignment.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

21. ### How do you redeclare variables in a switch block without an error

    When you try to redeclare variables using `let` or `const` in multiple `case` clauses of a `switch` statement, you will get a SyntaxError. This happens because, in JavaScript, all `case` clauses within a `switch` statement share the same block scope. For example:
    
    ```javascript
    let counter = 1;
    switch (x) {
      case 0:
        let name;
        break;
      case 1:
        let name; // SyntaxError: Identifier 'name' has already been declared
        break;
    }
    ```
    
    To avoid this error, you can create a new block scope within each `case` clause by wrapping the code in curly braces `{}`. This way, each `let` or `const` declaration is scoped only to that block, and redeclaration errors are avoided:
    
    ```javascript
    let counter = 1;
    switch (x) {
      case 0: {
        let name;
        // code for case 0
        break;
      }
      case 1: {
        let name; // No SyntaxError
        // code for case 1
        break;
      }
    }
    ```
    
    That means, to safely redeclare variables in different cases of a switch statement, wrap each case’s code in its own block using curly braces. This ensures each variable declaration is scoped to its specific case block.

22. ### What is the Temporal Dead Zone

    The **Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ)** refers to the period between the start of a block and the point where a variable declared with `let` or `const` is initialized. During this time, the variable exists in scope but **cannot be accessed**, and attempting to do so results in a `ReferenceError`.
    
    This behavior is part of **JavaScript's ES6 (ECMAScript 2015)** specification and applies **only to variables declared with `let` and `const`**, not `var`. Variables declared with `var` are **hoisted** and initialized with `undefined`, so accessing them before the declaration does not throw an error, though it can lead to unexpected results.
    
    #### Example
    
    ```javascript
    function someMethod() {
        console.log(counter1); // Output: undefined (due to var hoisting)
        console.log(counter2); // Throws ReferenceError (TDZ for let)
    
        var counter1 = 1;
        let counter2 = 2;
    }
    ```

23. ### What is an IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression)

    IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) is a JavaScript function that runs as soon as it is defined. The signature of it would be as below,

    ```javascript
    (function () {
      // logic here
    })();
    ```

    The primary reason to use an IIFE is to obtain data privacy because any variables declared within the IIFE cannot be accessed by the outside world. i.e, If you try to access variables from the IIFE then it throws an error as below,

    ```javascript
    (function () {
      var message = "IIFE";
      console.log(message);
    })();
    console.log(message); //Error: message is not defined
    ```

24. ### How do you decode or encode a URL in JavaScript?

    `encodeURI()` function is used to encode an URL. This function requires a URL string as a parameter and return that encoded string.
    `decodeURI()` function is used to decode an URL. This function requires an encoded URL string as parameter and return that decoded string.

    **Note:** If you want to encode characters such as `/ ? : @ & = + $ #` then you need to use `encodeURIComponent()`.

    ```javascript
    let uri = "employeeDetails?name=john&occupation=manager";
    let encoded_uri = encodeURI(uri);
    let decoded_uri = decodeURI(encoded_uri);
    ```

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

25. ### What is memoization

    Memoization is a functional programming technique which attempts to increase a function’s performance by caching its previously computed results. Each time a memoized function is called, its parameters are used to index the cache. If the data is present, then it can be returned, without executing the entire function. Otherwise the function is executed and then the result is added to the cache.
    Let's take an example of adding function with memoization,

    ```javascript
    const memoizeAddition = () => {
      let cache = {};
      return (value) => {
        if (value in cache) {
          console.log("Fetching from cache");
          return cache[value]; // Here, cache.value cannot be used as property name starts with the number which is not a valid JavaScript  identifier. Hence, can only be accessed using the square bracket notation.
        } else {
          console.log("Calculating result");
          let result = value + 20;
          cache[value] = result;
          return result;
        }
      };
    };
    // returned function from memoizeAddition
    const addition = memoizeAddition();
    console.log(addition(20)); //output: 40 calculated
    console.log(addition(20)); //output: 40 cached
    ```

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

26. ### What is Hoisting

 
Hoisting is JavaScript's default behavior where **variable and function declarations** are moved to the top of their scope before code execution. This means you can access certain variables and functions even before they are defined in the code.


Example of variable hoisting:

```js
console.log(message); // Output: undefined
var message = "The variable has been hoisted";
```

```js
var message;
console.log(message); // undefined
message = "The variable has been hoisted";
```

Example of function hoisting:

```js
message("Good morning"); // Output: Good morning

function message(name) {
  console.log(name);
}
```

Because of hoisting, functions can be used before they are declared.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

27. ### What are classes in ES6

    In ES6, Javascript classes are primarily syntactic sugar over JavaScript’s existing prototype-based inheritance.
    For example, the prototype based inheritance written in function expression as below,

    ```javascript
    function Bike(model, color) {
      this.model = model;
      this.color = color;
    }

    Bike.prototype.getDetails = function () {
      return this.model + " bike has" + this.color + " color";
    };
    ```

    Whereas ES6 classes can be defined as an alternative

    ```javascript
    class Bike {
      constructor(color, model) {
        this.color = color;
        this.model = model;
      }

      getDetails() {
        return this.model + " bike has" + this.color + " color";
      }
    }
    ```

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

28. ### What are closures

    A closure is the combination of a function bundled(enclosed) together with its lexical environment within which that function was declared. i.e, It is an inner function that has access to the outer or enclosing function’s variables, functions and other data even after the outer function has finished its execution. The closure has three scope chains.

    1. Own scope where variables defined between its curly brackets
    2. Outer function's variables
    3. Global variables

    Let's take an example of closure concept,

    ```javascript
    function Welcome(name) {
      var greetingInfo = function (message) {
        console.log(message + " " + name);
      };
      return greetingInfo;
    }
    var myFunction = Welcome("John");
    myFunction("Welcome "); //Output: Welcome John
    myFunction("Hello Mr."); //output: Hello Mr. John
    ```

    As per the above code, the inner function(i.e, greetingInfo) has access to the variables in the outer function scope(i.e, Welcome) even after the outer function has returned.

29. ### What are modules

    Modules refer to small units of independent, reusable code and also act as the foundation of many JavaScript design patterns. Most of the JavaScript modules export an object literal, a function, or a constructor

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

30. ### Why do you need modules

    Below are the list of benefits using modules in javascript ecosystem

    1. Maintainability
    2. Reusability
    3. Namespacing

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

31. ### What is scope in javascript

    Scope is the accessibility of variables, functions, and objects in some particular part of your code during runtime. In other words, scope determines the visibility of variables and other resources in areas of your code.

32. ### What is a service worker

    A Service worker is basically a script (JavaScript file) that runs in the background, separate from a web page and provides features that don't need a web page or user interaction. Some of the major features of service workers are Rich offline experiences(offline first web application development), periodic background syncs, push notifications, intercept and handle network requests and programmatically managing a cache of responses.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

33. ### How do you manipulate DOM using a service worker

    Service worker can't access the DOM directly. But it can communicate with the pages it controls by responding to messages sent via the `postMessage` interface, and those pages can manipulate the DOM.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

34. ### How do you reuse information across service worker restarts

    The problem with service worker is that it gets terminated when not in use, and restarted when it's next needed, so you cannot rely on global state within a service worker's `onfetch` and `onmessage` handlers. In this case, service workers will have access to IndexedDB API in order to persist and reuse across restarts.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

35. ### What is IndexedDB

    IndexedDB is a low-level API for client-side storage of larger amounts of structured data, including files/blobs. This API uses indexes to enable high-performance searches of this data.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

36. ### What is web storage

    Web storage is an API that provides a mechanism by which browsers can store key/value pairs locally within the user's browser, in a much more intuitive fashion than using cookies. The web storage provides two mechanisms for storing data on the client.

    1. **Local storage:** It stores data for current origin with no expiration date.
    2. **Session storage:** It stores data for one session and the data is lost when the browser tab is closed.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

37. ### What is a post message

    Post message is a method that enables cross-origin communication between Window objects.(i.e, between a page and a pop-up that it spawned, or between a page and an iframe embedded within it). Generally, scripts on different pages are allowed to access each other if and only if the pages follow same-origin policy(i.e, pages share the same protocol, port number, and host).

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

38. ### What is a Cookie

    A cookie is a piece of data that is stored on your computer to be accessed by your browser. Cookies are saved as key/value pairs.
    For example, you can create a cookie named username as below,

    ```javascript
    document.cookie = "username=John";
    ```

    ![Screenshot](images/cookie.png)

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

39. ### Why do you need a Cookie

    Cookies are used to remember information about the user profile(such as username). It basically involves two steps,

    1. When a user visits a web page, the user profile can be stored in a cookie.
    2. Next time the user visits the page, the cookie remembers the user profile.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

40. ### What are the options in a cookie

    There are few below options available for a cookie,

    1. By default, the cookie is deleted when the browser is closed but you can change this behavior by setting expiry date (in UTC time).

    ```javascript
    document.cookie = "username=John; expires=Sat, 8 Jun 2019 12:00:00 UTC";
    ```

    2. By default, the cookie belongs to a current page. But you can tell the browser what path the cookie belongs to using a path parameter.

    ```javascript
    document.cookie = "username=John; path=/services";
    ```

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

41. ### How do you delete a cookie

    You can delete a cookie by setting the expiry date as a passed date. You don't need to specify a cookie value in this case.
    For example, you can delete a username cookie in the current page as below.

    ```javascript
    document.cookie =
      "username=; expires=Fri, 07 Jun 2019 00:00:00 UTC; path=/;";
    ```

    **Note:** You should define the cookie path option to ensure that you delete the right cookie. Some browsers doesn't allow to delete a cookie unless you specify a path parameter.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

42. ### What are the differences between cookie, local storage and session storage

    Below are some of the differences between cookie, local storage and session storage,

    | Feature                           | Cookie                                                                                                              | Local storage         | Session storage     |
    | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------- |
    | Accessed on client or server side | Both server-side & client-side. The `set-cookie` HTTP response header is used by server inorder to send it to user. | client-side only      | client-side only    |
    | Expiry                            | Manually configured using Expires option                                                                            | Forever until deleted | until tab is closed |
    | SSL support                       | Supported                                                                                                           | Not supported         | Not supported       |

43. ### What is the main difference between localStorage and sessionStorage

    LocalStorage is the same as SessionStorage but it persists the data even when the browser is closed and reopened(i.e it has no expiration time) whereas in sessionStorage data gets cleared when the page session ends.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

44. ### How do you access web storage

    The Window object implements the `WindowLocalStorage` and `WindowSessionStorage` objects which has `localStorage`(window.localStorage) and `sessionStorage`(window.sessionStorage) properties respectively. These properties create an instance of the Storage object, through which data items can be set, retrieved and removed for a specific domain and storage type (session or local).
    For example, you can read and write on local storage objects as below

    ```javascript
    localStorage.setItem("logo", document.getElementById("logo").value);
    localStorage.getItem("logo");
    ```

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

45. ### What are the methods available on session storage

    The session storage provided methods for reading, writing and clearing the session data

    ```javascript
    // Save data to sessionStorage
    sessionStorage.setItem("key", "value");

    // Get saved data from sessionStorage
    let data = sessionStorage.getItem("key");

    // Remove saved data from sessionStorage
    sessionStorage.removeItem("key");

    // Remove all saved data from sessionStorage
    sessionStorage.clear();
    ```

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

46. ### What is a storage event and its event handler

    The StorageEvent is an event that fires when a storage area has been changed in the context of another document. Whereas onstorage property is an EventHandler for processing storage events.
    The syntax would be as below

    ```javascript
    window.onstorage = functionRef;
    ```

    Let's take the example usage of onstorage event handler which logs the storage key and it's values

    ```javascript
    window.onstorage = function (e) {
      console.log(
        "The " +
          e.key +
          " key has been changed from " +
          e.oldValue +
          " to " +
          e.newValue +
          "."
      );
    };
    ```

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

47. ### Why do you need web storage

    Web storage is more secure, and large amounts of data can be stored locally, without affecting website performance. Also, the information is never transferred to the server. Hence this is a more recommended approach than Cookies.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

48. ### How do you check web storage browser support

    You need to check browser support for localStorage and sessionStorage before using web storage,

    ```javascript
    if (typeof Storage !== "undefined") {
      // Code for localStorage/sessionStorage.
    } else {
      // Sorry! No Web Storage support..
    }
    ```

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

49. ### How do you check web workers browser support

    You need to check browser support for web workers before using it

    ```javascript
    if (typeof Worker !== "undefined") {
      // code for Web worker support.
    } else {
      // Sorry! No Web Worker support..
    }
    ```

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

50. ### Give an example of a web worker

    You need to follow below steps to start using web workers for counting example

    1. Create a Web Worker File: You need to write a script to increment the count value. Let's name it as counter.js

    ```javascript
    let i = 0;

    function timedCount() {
      i = i + 1;
      postMessage(i);
      setTimeout("timedCount()", 500);
    }

    timedCount();
    ```

    Here postMessage() method is used to post a message back to the HTML page

    2. Create a Web Worker Object: You can create a web worker object by checking for browser support. Let's name this file as web_worker_example.js

    ```javascript
    if (typeof w == "undefined") {
      w = new Worker("counter.js");
    }
    ```

    and we can receive messages from web worker

    ```javascript
    w.onmessage = function (event) {
      document.getElementById("message").innerHTML = event.data;
    };
    ```

    3. Terminate a Web Worker:
       Web workers will continue to listen for messages (even after the external script is finished) until it is terminated. You can use the terminate() method to terminate listening to the messages.

    ```javascript
    w.terminate();
    ```

    4. Reuse the Web Worker: If you set the worker variable to undefined you can reuse the code

    ```javascript
    w = undefined;
    ```

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

51. ### What are the restrictions of web workers on DOM

    WebWorkers don't have access to below javascript objects since they are defined in an external files

    1. Window object
    2. Document object
    3. Parent object

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

52. ### What is a promise
    A **Promise** is a JavaScript object that represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value. It acts as a placeholder for a value that may not be available yet but will be resolved in the future.

    A Promise can be in one of **three states**:
    - `pending`: Initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected.
    - `fulfilled`: The operation completed successfully.
    - `rejected`: The operation failed (e.g., due to a network error).


    #### Promise Syntax

    ```javascript
    const promise = new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {
      // Perform async operation
    });
    ```
    #### Example: Creating and Using a Promise
    ```javascript
    const promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
      setTimeout(() => {
        resolve("I'm a Promise!");
      }, 5000);
    });

    promise
      .then((value) => console.log(value)) // Logs after 5 seconds: "I'm a Promise!"
      .catch((error) => console.error(error))  // Handles any rejection
      .finally(() => console.log("Done"));     // Runs regardless of success or failure
    ```
    In the above example:

    *   A `Promise` is created to handle an asynchronous operation with `resolve` and `reject` callbacks.
    *   The `setTimeout` resolves the promise with a value after 5 seconds.
    *   `.then()`, `.catch()`, and `.finally()` are used to handle success, errors, and cleanup respectively.

    The action flow of a promise will be as below,

    ![Screenshot](images/promises.png)

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

53. ### Why do you need a promise
    Promises are **used to handle asynchronous operations**, especially in languages like JavaScript, which often work with non-blocking operations such as network requests, file I/O, and timers. When an operation is asynchronous, it doesn't immediately return a result; instead, it works in the background and provides the result later. Handling this in a clean, organized way can be difficult without a structured approach.

    Promises are used to:

    1.  **Handle asynchronous operations**.
    2.  **Provide a cleaner alternative to callbacks**.
    3.  **Avoid callback hell**.
    4.  **Make code more readable and maintainable**.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

54. ### Explain the three states of promise

    Promises have three states:

    1. **Pending:** This is an initial state of the Promise before an operation begins
    2. **Fulfilled:** This state indicates that the specified operation was completed.
    3. **Rejected:** This state indicates that the operation did not complete. In this case an error value will be thrown.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

55. ### What is a callback function

    A callback function is a function passed into another function as an argument. This function is invoked inside the outer function to complete an action.
    Let's take a simple example of how to use callback function

    ```javascript
    function callbackFunction(name) {
      console.log("Hello " + name);
    }

    function outerFunction(callback) {
      let name = prompt("Please enter your name.");
      callback(name);
    }

    outerFunction(callbackFunction);
    ```

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

56. ### Why do we need callbacks

    The callbacks are needed because javascript is an event driven language. That means instead of waiting for a response, javascript will keep executing while listening for other events.
    Let's take an example with the first function invoking an API call(simulated by setTimeout) and the next function which logs the message.

    ```javascript
    function firstFunction() {
      // Simulate a code delay
      setTimeout(function () {
        console.log("First function called");
      }, 1000);
    }
    function secondFunction() {
      console.log("Second function called");
    }
    firstFunction();
    secondFunction();

    // Output:
    // Second function called
    // First function called
    ```

    As observed from the output, javascript didn't wait for the response of the first function and the remaining code block got executed. So callbacks are used in a way to make sure that certain code doesn’t execute until the other code finishes execution.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

57. ### What is a callback hell

    Callback Hell is an anti-pattern with multiple nested callbacks which makes code hard to read and debug when dealing with asynchronous logic. The callback hell looks like below,

    ```javascript
    async1(function(){
        async2(function(){
            async3(function(){
                async4(function(){
                    ....
                });
            });
        });
    });
    ```

58. ### What are server-sent events

    Server-sent events (SSE) is a server push technology enabling a browser to receive automatic updates from a server via HTTP connection without resorting to polling. These are a one way communications channel - events flow from server to client only. This has been used in Facebook/Twitter/X updates, stock price updates, news feeds etc.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

59. ### How do you receive server-sent event notifications

    The EventSource object is used to receive server-sent event notifications. For example, you can receive messages from server as below,

    ```javascript
    if (typeof EventSource !== "undefined") {
      var source = new EventSource("sse_generator.js");
      source.onmessage = function (event) {
        document.getElementById("output").innerHTML += event.data + "<br>";
      };
    }
    ```

60. ### How do you check browser support for server-sent events

    You can perform browser support for server-sent events before using it as below,

    ```javascript
    if (typeof EventSource !== "undefined") {
      // Server-sent events supported. Let's have some code here!
    } else {
      // No server-sent events supported
    }
    ```

61. ### What are the events available for server sent events

    Below are the list of events available for server sent events
    | Event | Description |
    |---- | ---------
    | onopen | It is used when a connection to the server is opened |
    | onmessage | This event is used when a message is received |
    | onerror | It happens when an error occurs|

62. ### What are the main rules of promise

    A promise must follow a specific set of rules:

    1. A promise is an object that supplies a standard-compliant `.then()` method
    2. A pending promise may transition into either fulfilled or rejected state
    3. A fulfilled or rejected promise is settled and it must not transition into any other state.
    4. Once a promise is settled, the value must not change.

63. ### What is callback in callback

    You can nest one callback inside in another callback to execute the actions sequentially one by one. This is known as callbacks in callbacks. Beware, too many levels of nesting lead to [Callback hell](https://github.com/sudheerj/javascript-interview-questions?tab=readme-ov-file#what-is-a-callback-hell)

    ```javascript
    loadScript("/script1.js", function (script) {
      console.log("first script is loaded");

      loadScript("/script2.js", function (script) {
        console.log("second script is loaded");

        loadScript("/script3.js", function (script) {
          console.log("third script is loaded");
          // after all scripts are loaded
        });
      });
    });
    ```

64. ### What is promise chaining

    The process of executing a sequence of asynchronous tasks one after another using promises is known as Promise chaining. Let's take an example of promise chaining for calculating the final result,

    ```javascript
    new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {
      setTimeout(() => resolve(1), 1000);
    })
      .then(function (result) {
        console.log(result); // 1
        return result * 2;
      })
      .then(function (result) {
        console.log(result); // 2
        return result * 3;
      })
      .then(function (result) {
        console.log(result); // 6
        return result * 4;
      });
    ```

    In the above handlers, the result is passed to the chain of .then() handlers with the below work flow,

    1. The initial promise resolves in 1 second,
    2. After that `.then` handler is called by logging the result(1) and then return a promise with the value of result \* 2.
    3. After that the value passed to the next `.then` handler by logging the result(2) and return a promise with result \* 3.
    4. Finally the value passed to the last `.then` handler by logging the result(6) and return a promise with result \* 4.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

65. ### What is promise.all

    Promise.all is a promise that takes an array of promises as an input (an iterable), and it gets resolved when all the promises get resolved or any one of them gets rejected. For example, the syntax of promise.all method is below,

    ```javascript
    Promise.all([Promise1, Promise2, Promise3]) .then(result) => {   console.log(result) }) .catch(error => console.log(`Error in promises ${error}`))
    ```

    **Note:** Remember that the order of the promises(output the result) is maintained as per input order.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

66. ### What is the purpose of the race method in promise

    Promise.race() method will return the promise instance which is firstly resolved or rejected. Let's take an example of race() method where promise2 is resolved first

    ```javascript
    var promise1 = new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {
      setTimeout(resolve, 500, "one");
    });
    var promise2 = new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {
      setTimeout(resolve, 100, "two");
    });

    Promise.race([promise1, promise2]).then(function (value) {
      console.log(value); // "two" // Both promises will resolve, but promise2 is faster
    });
    ```

67. ### What is a strict mode in javascript

    JavaScript’s "use strict" directive is used to opt into a stricter parsing and error-handling mode for your scripts or functions. It helps catch common bugs, makes your code more secure, and prepares it for future versions of JavaScript.

    Strict Mode is a new feature in ECMAScript 5 that allows you to place a program, or a function, in a “strict” operating context. This way it prevents certain actions from being taken and throws more exceptions. The literal expression `"use strict";` instructs the browser to use the javascript code in the Strict mode. This also enables block-scoped variables.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

68. ### Why do you need strict mode

    Strict mode is useful to write "secure" JavaScript by notifying "bad syntax" into real errors. For example, it eliminates accidentally creating a global variable by throwing an error and also throws an error for assignment to a non-writable property, a getter-only property, a non-existing property, a non-existing variable, or a non-existing object.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

69. ### How do you declare strict mode

    The strict mode is declared by adding "use strict"; to the beginning of a script or a function.
    If declared at the beginning of a script, it has global scope.

    ```javascript
    "use strict";
    x = 3.14; // This will cause an error because x is not declared
    ```

    and if you declare inside a function, it has local scope

    ```javascript
    x = 3.14; // This will not cause an error.
    myFunction();

    function myFunction() {
      "use strict";
      y = 3.14; // This will cause an error
    }
    ```

70. ### What is the purpose of double exclamation

    The double exclamation or negation(!!) ensures the resulting type is a boolean. If it was falsey (e.g. 0, null, undefined, etc.), it will be false, otherwise, it will be true.
    For example, you can test IE version using this expression as below,

    ```javascript
    let isIE8 = false;
    isIE8 = !!navigator.userAgent.match(/MSIE 8.0/);
    console.log(isIE8); // returns true or false
    ```

    If you don't use this expression then it returns the original value.

    ```javascript
    console.log(navigator.userAgent.match(/MSIE 8.0/)); // returns either an Array or null
    ```

    **Note:** The expression !! is not an operator, but it is just twice of ! operator.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

71. ### What is the purpose of the delete operator

    The delete operator is used to delete the property as well as its value.

    ```javascript
    var user = { firstName: "John", lastName: "Doe", age: 20 };
    delete user.age;

    console.log(user); // {firstName: "John", lastName:"Doe"}
    ```

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

72. ### What is typeof operator

    You can use the JavaScript typeof operator to find the type of a JavaScript variable. It returns the type of a variable or an expression.

    ```javascript
    typeof "John Abraham"; // Returns "string"
    typeof (1 + 2); // Returns "number"
    typeof [1, 2, 3]; // Returns "object" because all arrays are also objects
    ```

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

73. ### What is undefined property

    The undefined property indicates that a variable has not been assigned a value, or declared but not initialized at all. The type of undefined value is undefined too.

    ```javascript
    var user; // Value is undefined, type is undefined
    console.log(typeof user); //undefined
    ```

    Any variable can be emptied by setting the value to undefined.

    ```javascript
    user = undefined;
    ```

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

74. ### What is null value

    The value null represents the intentional absence of any object value. It is one of JavaScript's primitive values. The type of null value is object.
    You can empty the variable by setting the value to null.

    ```javascript
    var user = null;
    console.log(typeof user); //object
    ```

75. ### What is the difference between null and undefined

    Below are the main differences between null and undefined,

    | Null                                                                                            | Undefined                                                                                               |
    | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | It is an assignment value which indicates that variable points to no object.                    | It is not an assignment value where a variable has been declared but has not yet been assigned a value. |
    | Type of null is object                                                                          | Type of undefined is undefined                                                                          |
    | The null value is a primitive value that represents the null, empty, or non-existent reference. | The undefined value is a primitive value used when a variable has not been assigned a value.            |
    | Indicates the absence of a value for a variable                                                 | Indicates absence of variable itself                                                                    |
    | Converted to zero (0) while performing primitive operations                                     | Converted to NaN while performing primitive operations                                                  |

77. ### What is the difference between window and document

    Below are the main differences between window and document,

    | Window                                                                        | Document                                                                                       |
    | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | It is the root level element in any web page                                  | It is the direct child of the window object. This is also known as Document Object Model (DOM) |
    | By default window object is available implicitly in the page                  | You can access it via window.document or document.                                             |
    | It has methods like alert(), confirm() and properties like document, location | It provides methods like getElementById, getElementsByTagName, createElement etc               |

78. ### How do you access history in javascript

    The window.history object contains the browser's history. You can load previous and next URLs in the history using back() and next() methods.

    ```javascript
    function goBack() {
      window.history.back();
    }
    function goForward() {
      window.history.forward();
    }
    ```

    **Note:** You can also access history without window prefix.

79. ### How do you detect caps lock key turned on or not

    The `mouseEvent getModifierState()` is used to return a boolean value that indicates whether the specified modifier key is activated or not. The modifiers such as CapsLock, ScrollLock and NumLock are activated when they are clicked, and deactivated when they are clicked again.

    Let's take an input element to detect the CapsLock on/off behavior with an example:

    ```html
    <input type="password" onmousedown="enterInput(event)" />

    <p id="feedback"></p>

    <script>
      function enterInput(e) {
        var flag = e.getModifierState("CapsLock");
        if (flag) {
          document.getElementById("feedback").innerHTML = "CapsLock activated";
        } else {
          document.getElementById("feedback").innerHTML =
            "CapsLock not activated";
        }
      }
    </script>
    ```

80. ### What is isNaN

    The isNaN() function is used to determine whether a value is an illegal number (Not-a-Number) or not. i.e, This function returns true if the value equates to NaN. Otherwise it returns false.

    ```javascript
    isNaN("Hello"); //true
    isNaN("100"); //false
    ```

81. ### What are the differences between undeclared and undefined variables

    Below are the major differences between undeclared(not defined) and undefined variables,

    | undeclared                                                                                  | undefined                                                                              |
    | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | These variables do not exist in a program and are not declared                              | These variables declared in the program but have not assigned any value                |
    | If you try to read the value of an undeclared variable, then a runtime error is encountered | If you try to read the value of an undefined variable, an undefined value is returned. |

    ```javascript
    var a;
    a; // yields undefined

    b; // Throws runtime error like "Uncaught ReferenceError: b is not defined"
    ```
    This can be confusing, because it says `not defined` instead of `not declared` (Chrome)

82. ### What are global variables

    Global variables are those that are available throughout the length of the code without any scope. The var keyword is used to declare a local variable but if you omit it then it will become global variable

    ```javascript
    msg = "Hello"; // var is missing, it becomes global variable
    ```

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

83. ### What are the problems with global variables

    The problem with global variables is the conflict of variable names of local and global scope. It is also difficult to debug and test the code that relies on global variables.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

84. ### What is NaN property

    The NaN property is a global property that represents "Not-a-Number" value. i.e, It indicates that a value is not a legal number. It is very rare to use NaN in a program but it can be used as return value for few cases

    ```javascript
    Math.sqrt(-1);
    parseInt("Hello");
    ```

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

85. ### What is the purpose of isFinite function

    The isFinite() function is used to determine whether a number is a finite, legal number. It returns false if the value is +infinity, -infinity, or NaN (Not-a-Number), otherwise it returns true.

    ```javascript
    isFinite(Infinity); // false
    isFinite(NaN); // false
    isFinite(-Infinity); // false

    isFinite(100); // true
    ```

86. ### What is an event flow

    Event flow refers to the order in which events are handled in the browser when a user interacts with elements on a webpage like clicking, typing, hovering, etc.

    When you click an element that is nested in various other elements, before your click actually reaches its destination, or target element, it must trigger the click event for each of its parent elements first, starting at the top with the global window object.

    Hence, there are three phases in JavaScript’s event flow:

    1. Event Capturing(Top to Bottom): The event starts from the window/document and moves down the DOM tree toward the target element.
    2. Target phase: The event reaches the target element — the element that was actually interacted with.
    3. Event Bubbling(Bottom to Top): The event then bubbles back up from the target element to the root.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

87. ### What is event capturing

    Event capturing is a phase of event propagation in which an event is first intercepted by the outermost ancestor element, then travels downward through the DOM hierarchy until it reaches the target (innermost) element.

    To handle events during the capturing phase, you need to pass `true` as the third argument to the `addEventListener` method.

     ```javascript
      <div>
        <button class="child">Hello</button>
      </div>

      <script>
        const parent = document.querySelector("div");
        const child = document.querySelector(".child");

        // Capturing phase: parent listener (runs first)
        parent.addEventListener("click", function () {
          console.log("Parent (capturing)");
        }, true); // `true` enables capturing

        // Bubbling phase: child listener (runs after)
        child.addEventListener("click", function () {
          console.log("Child (bubbling)");
        });
      </script>
      // Parent (capturing)
      // Child (bubbling)
     ```

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

88. ### What is event bubbling

    Event bubbling is a type of event propagation in which an event first triggers on the innermost target element (the one the user interacted with), and then bubbles up through its ancestors in the DOM hierarchy — eventually reaching the outermost elements, like the document or window.

    By default, event listeners in JavaScript are triggered during the bubbling phase, unless specified otherwise.

    ```javascript
    <div>
      <button class="child">Hello</button>
    </div>

    <script>
      const parent = document.querySelector("div");
      const child = document.querySelector(".child");

      // Bubbling phase (default)
      parent.addEventListener("click", function () {
        console.log("Parent");
      });

      child.addEventListener("click", function () {
        console.log("Child");
      });
    </script>
    //Child
    //Parent
    ```

    Here, at first, the event triggers on the child button. Thereafter it bubbles up and triggers the parent div's event handler.

89. ### How do you submit a form using JavaScript

    You can submit a form using `document.forms[0].submit()`. All the form input's information is submitted using onsubmit event handler

91. ### What is the difference between document load and DOMContentLoaded events

    The `DOMContentLoaded` event is fired when the initial HTML document has been completely loaded and parsed, without waiting for assets(stylesheets, images, and subframes) to finish loading. Whereas The load event is fired when the whole page has loaded, including all dependent resources(stylesheets, images).

92. ### What is the difference between native, host and user objects

    `Native objects` are objects that are part of the JavaScript language defined by the ECMAScript specification. For example, String, Math, RegExp, Object, Function etc core objects defined in the ECMAScript spec.
    `Host objects` are objects provided by the browser or runtime environment (Node).

    For example, window, XmlHttpRequest, DOM nodes etc are considered as host objects.
    `User objects` are objects defined in the javascript code. For example, User objects created for profile information.

94. ### What are the pros and cons of promises over callbacks

    Below are the list of pros and cons of promises over callbacks,

    **Pros:**

    1. It avoids callback hell which is unreadable
    2. Easy to write sequential asynchronous code with .then()
    3. Easy to write parallel asynchronous code with Promise.all()
    4. Solves some of the common problems of callbacks(call the callback too late, too early, many times and swallow errors/exceptions)

    **Cons:**

    5. It makes little complex code
    6. You need to load a polyfill if ES6 is not supported

95. ### What is the difference between an attribute and a property

    Attributes are defined on the HTML markup whereas properties are defined on the DOM. For example, the below HTML element has 2 attributes: `type` and `value`,

    ```javascript
    <input type="text" value="Name:">
    ```

    You can retrieve the attribute value as below, for example after typing "Good morning" into the input field:

    ```javascript
    const input = document.querySelector("input");
    console.log(input.getAttribute("value")); // Good morning
    console.log(input.value); // Good morning
    ```

    And after you change the value of the text field to "Good evening", it becomes like

    ```javascript
    console.log(input.getAttribute("value")); // Good evening
    console.log(input.value); // Good evening
    ```

96. ### What is same-origin policy

    The same-origin policy is a policy that prevents JavaScript from making requests across domain boundaries. An origin is defined as a combination of URI scheme, hostname, and port number. If you enable this policy then it prevents a malicious script on one page from obtaining access to sensitive data on another web page using Document Object Model(DOM).

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

97. ### What is the purpose of void 0

    Void(0) is used to prevent the page from refreshing. This will be helpful to eliminate the unwanted side-effect, because it will return the undefined primitive value. It is commonly used for HTML documents that use href="JavaScript:Void(0);" within an `<a>` element. i.e, when you click a link, the browser loads a new page or refreshes the same page. But this behavior will be prevented using this expression.
    For example, the below link notify the message without reloading the page

    ```javascript
    <a href="JavaScript:void(0);" onclick="alert('Well done!')">
      Click Me!
    </a>
    ```

98. ### Is JavaScript a compiled or interpreted language

    JavaScript is an interpreted language, not a compiled language. An interpreter in the browser reads over the JavaScript code, interprets each line, and runs it. Nowadays modern browsers use a technology known as Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation, which compiles JavaScript to executable bytecode just as it is about to run.

99. ### Is JavaScript a case-sensitive language

    Yes, JavaScript is a case sensitive language. The language keywords, variables, function & object names, and any other identifiers must always be typed with a consistent capitalization of letters.

100. ### Is there any relation between Java and JavaScript

      No, they are entirely two different programming languages and have nothing to do with each other. But both of them are Object Oriented Programming languages and like many other languages, they follow similar syntax for basic features(if, else, for, switch, break, continue etc).

101. ### What are events

      Events are "things" that happen to HTML elements. When JavaScript is used in HTML pages, JavaScript can `react` on these events. Some of the examples of HTML events are,

      1. Web page has finished loading
      2. Input field was changed
      3. Button was clicked

      Let's describe the behavior of click event for button element,

      ```javascript
      <!doctype html>
      <html>
       <head>
         <script>
           function greeting() {
             alert('Hello! Good morning');
           }
         </script>
       </head>
       <body>
         <button type="button" onclick="greeting()">Click me</button>
       </body>
      </html>
      ```

102. ### Who created javascript

      JavaScript was created by Brendan Eich in 1995 during his time at Netscape Communications. Initially it was developed under the name `Mocha`, but later the language was officially called `LiveScript` when it first shipped in beta releases of Netscape.

103. ### What is the use of preventDefault method

      The preventDefault() method cancels the event if it is cancelable, meaning that the default action or behaviour that belongs to the event will not occur. For example, prevent form submission when clicking on submit button and prevent opening the page URL when clicking on hyperlink are some common use cases.

      ```javascript
      document
        .getElementById("link")
        .addEventListener("click", function (event) {
          event.preventDefault();
        });
      ```

      **Note:** Remember that not all events are cancelable.

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

104. ### What is the use of stopPropagation method

      The stopPropagation method is used to stop the event from bubbling up the event chain. For example, the below nested divs with stopPropagation method prevents default event propagation when clicking on nested div(Div1)

      ```javascript
      <p>Click DIV1 Element</p>
      <div onclick="secondFunc()">DIV 2
        <div onclick="firstFunc(event)">DIV 1</div>
      </div>

      <script>
      function firstFunc(event) {
        alert("DIV 1");
        event.stopPropagation();
      }

      function secondFunc() {
        alert("DIV 2");
      }
      </script>
      ```

105. ### What are the steps involved in return false usage

      The return false statement in event handlers performs the below steps,

      1. First it stops the browser's default action or behaviour.
      2. It prevents the event from propagating the DOM
      3. Stops callback execution and returns immediately when called.

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

106. ### What is BOM

      The Browser Object Model (BOM) allows JavaScript to "talk to" the browser. It consists of the objects navigator, history, screen, location and document which are children of the window. The Browser Object Model is not standardized and can change based on different browsers.

107. ### What is the use of setTimeout

      The setTimeout() method is used to call a function or evaluate an expression after a specified number of milliseconds. For example, let's log a message after 2 seconds using setTimeout method,

      ```javascript
      setTimeout(function () {
        console.log("Good morning");
      }, 2000);
      ```

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

108. ### What is the use of setInterval

      The setInterval() method is used to call a function or evaluate an expression at specified intervals (in milliseconds). For example, let's log a message after 2 seconds using setInterval method,

      ```javascript
      setInterval(function () {
        console.log("Good morning");
      }, 2000);
      ```

109. ### Why is JavaScript treated as Single threaded

      JavaScript is a single-threaded language. Because the language specification does not allow the programmer to write code so that the interpreter can run parts of it in parallel in multiple threads or processes. Whereas languages like java, go, C++ can make multi-threaded and multi-process programs.

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

110. ### What is an event delegation

      Event delegation is a technique for listening to events where you delegate a parent element as the listener for all of the events that happen inside it.

      For example, if you wanted to detect field changes inside a specific form, you can use event delegation technique,

      ```javascript
      var form = document.querySelector("#registration-form");

      // Listen for changes to fields inside the form
      form.addEventListener(
        "input",
        function (event) {
          // Log the field that was changed
          console.log(event.target);
        },
        false
      );
      ```

111. ### What is ECMAScript

      ECMAScript is the scripting language that forms the basis of JavaScript. ECMAScript standardized by the ECMA International standards organization in the ECMA-262 and ECMA-402 specifications. The first edition of ECMAScript was released in 1997.

112. ### What is JSON

      JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight format that is used for data interchanging. It is based on a subset of JavaScript language in the way objects are built in JavaScript.

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

113. ### What are the syntax rules of JSON

      Below are the list of syntax rules of JSON

      1. The data is in name/value pairs
      2. The data is separated by commas
      3. Curly braces hold objects
      4. Square brackets hold arrays

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

114. ### What is the purpose JSON stringify

      When sending data to a web server, the data has to be in a string format. You can achieve this by converting JSON object into a string using stringify() method.

      ```javascript
      var userJSON = { name: "John", age: 31 };
      var userString = JSON.stringify(userJSON);
      console.log(userString); //"{"name":"John","age":31}"
      ```

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

115. ### How do you parse JSON string

      When receiving the data from a web server, the data is always in a string format. But you can convert this string value to a javascript object using parse() method.

      ```javascript
      var userString = '{"name":"John","age":31}';
      var userJSON = JSON.parse(userString);
      console.log(userJSON); // {name: "John", age: 31}
      ```

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

116. ### Why do you need JSON

      When exchanging data between a browser and a server, the data can only be text. Since JSON is text only, it can easily be sent to and from a server, and used as a data format by any programming language.

117. ### What are PWAs

      Progressive web applications (PWAs) are a type of mobile app delivered through the web, built using common web technologies including HTML, CSS and JavaScript. These PWAs are deployed to servers, accessible through URLs, and indexed by search engines.

118. ### What is the purpose of clearTimeout method

      The clearTimeout() function is used in javascript to clear the timeout which has been set by setTimeout()function before that. i.e, The return value of setTimeout() function is stored in a variable and it’s passed into the clearTimeout() function to clear the timer.

      For example, the below setTimeout method is used to display the message after 3 seconds. This timeout can be cleared by the clearTimeout() method.

      ```javascript
      <script>
           var msg;
           function greeting() {
              alert('Good morning');
           }
           function start() {
             msg =setTimeout(greeting, 3000);

           }

           function stop() {
               clearTimeout(msg);
           }
      </script>
      ```

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

119. ### What is the purpose of clearInterval method

      The clearInterval() function is used in javascript to clear the interval which has been set by setInterval() function. i.e, The return value returned by setInterval() function is stored in a variable and it’s passed into the clearInterval() function to clear the interval.

      For example, the below setInterval method is used to display the message for every 3 seconds. This interval can be cleared by the clearInterval() method.

      ```javascript
      <script>
           var msg;
           function greeting() {
              alert('Good morning');
           }
           function start() {
             msg = setInterval(greeting, 3000);

           }

           function stop() {
               clearInterval(msg);
           }
      </script>
      ```

120. ### How do you redirect new page in javascript

      In vanilla javascript, you can redirect to a new page using the `location` property of window object. The syntax would be as follows,

      ```javascript
      function redirect() {
        window.location.href = "newPage.html";
      }
      ```

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

121. ### How do you check whether a string contains a substring

      There are 3 possible ways to check whether a string contains a substring or not,

      1. **Using includes:** ES6 provided `String.prototype.includes` method to test a string contains a substring

      ```javascript
      var mainString = "hello",
        subString = "hell";
      mainString.includes(subString);
      ```

      2. **Using indexOf:** In an ES5 or older environment, you can use `String.prototype.indexOf` which returns the index of a substring. If the index value is not equal to -1 then it means the substring exists in the main string.

      ```javascript
      var mainString = "hello",
        subString = "hell";
      mainString.indexOf(subString) !== -1;
      ```

      3. **Using RegEx:** The advanced solution is using Regular expression's test method(`RegExp.test`), which allows for testing for against regular expressions

      ```javascript
      var mainString = "hello",
        regex = /hell/;
      regex.test(mainString);
      ```

122. ### How do you validate an email in javascript

      You can validate an email in javascript using regular expressions. It is recommended to do validations on the server side instead of the client side. Because the javascript can be disabled on the client side.

      ```javascript
      function validateEmail(email) {
        var re =
          /^(([^<>()\[\]\\.,;:\s@"]+(\.[^<>()\[\]\\.,;:\s@"]+)*)|(".+"))@((\[[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\])|(([a-zA-Z\-0-9]+\.)+[a-zA-Z]{2,}))$/;
        return re.test(String(email).toLowerCase());
      }
      ```

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

      The above regular expression accepts unicode characters.

123. ### How do you get the current url with javascript

      You can use `window.location.href` expression to get the current url path and you can use the same expression for updating the URL too. You can also use `document.URL` for read-only purposes but this solution has issues in FF.

      ```javascript
      console.log("location.href", window.location.href); // Returns full URL
      ```

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

124. ### What are the various url properties of location object

      The below `Location` object properties can be used to access URL components of the page,

      1. href - The entire URL
      2. protocol - The protocol of the URL
      3. host - The hostname and port of the URL
      4. hostname - The hostname of the URL
      5. port - The port number in the URL
      6. pathname - The path name of the URL
      7. search - The query portion of the URL
      8. hash - The anchor portion of the URL

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

125. ### How do get query string values in javascript

      You can use URLSearchParams to get query string values in javascript. Let's see an example to get the client code value from URL query string,

      ```javascript
      const urlParams = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search);
      const clientCode = urlParams.get("clientCode");
      ```

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

126. ### How do you check if a key exists in an object

      You can check whether a key exists in an object or not using three approaches,

      1. **Using in operator:** You can use the in operator whether a key exists in an object or not

         ```javascript
         "key" in obj;
         ```

         and If you want to check if a key doesn't exist, remember to use parenthesis,

         ```javascript
         !("key" in obj);
         ```

      2. **Using hasOwnProperty method:** You can use `hasOwnProperty` to particularly test for properties of the object instance (and not inherited properties)

         ```javascript
         obj.hasOwnProperty("key"); // true
         ```

      3. **Using undefined comparison:** If you access a non-existing property from an object, the result is undefined. Let’s compare the properties against undefined to determine the existence of the property.

         ```javascript
         const user = {
           name: "John",
         };

         console.log(user.name !== undefined); // true
         console.log(user.nickName !== undefined); // false
         ```

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

127. ### How do you loop through or enumerate javascript object

      You can use the `for-in` loop to loop through javascript object. You can also make sure that the key you get is an actual property of an object, and doesn't come from the prototype using `hasOwnProperty` method.

      ```javascript
      var object = {
        k1: "value1",
        k2: "value2",
        k3: "value3",
      };

      for (var key in object) {
        if (object.hasOwnProperty(key)) {
          console.log(key + " -> " + object[key]); // k1 -> value1 ...
        }
      }
      ```

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

128. ### How do you test for an empty object

      There are different solutions based on ECMAScript versions

      1. **Using Object entries(ECMA 7+):** You can use object entries length along with constructor type.

      ```javascript
      Object.entries(obj).length === 0 && obj.constructor === Object; // Since date object length is 0, you need to check constructor check as well
      ```

      2. **Using Object keys(ECMA 5+):** You can use object keys length along with constructor type.

      ```javascript
      Object.keys(obj).length === 0 && obj.constructor === Object; // Since date object length is 0, you need to check constructor check as well
      ```

      3. **Using for-in with hasOwnProperty(Pre-ECMA 5):** You can use a for-in loop along with hasOwnProperty.

      ```javascript
      function isEmpty(obj) {
        for (var prop in obj) {
          if (obj.hasOwnProperty(prop)) {
            return false;
          }
        }

        return JSON.stringify(obj) === JSON.stringify({});
      }
      ```

129. ### What is an arguments object

      The arguments object is an Array-like object accessible inside functions that contains the values of the arguments passed to that function. For example, let's see how to use arguments object inside sum function,

      ```javascript
      function sum() {
        var total = 0;
        for (var i = 0, len = arguments.length; i < len; ++i) {
          total += arguments[i];
        }
        return total;
      }

      sum(1, 2, 3); // returns 6
      ```

      **Note:** You can't apply array methods on arguments object. But you can convert into a regular array as below.

      ```javascript
      var argsArray = Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments);
      ```

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

130. ### How do you make first letter of the string in an uppercase

      You can create a function which uses a chain of string methods such as charAt, toUpperCase and slice methods to generate a string with the first letter in uppercase.

      ```javascript
      function capitalizeFirstLetter(string) {
        return string.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + string.slice(1);
      }
      ```

131. ### What are the pros and cons of for loops

      The for-loop is a commonly used iteration syntax in javascript. It has both pros and cons

      #### Pros

      1. Works on every environment
      2. You can use break and continue flow control statements

      #### Cons

      3. Too verbose
      4. Imperative
      5. You might face off-by-one errors.

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

132. ### How do you display the current date in javascript

      You can use `new Date()` to generate a new Date object containing the current date and time. For example, let's display the current date in mm/dd/yyyy

      ```javascript
      var today = new Date();
      var dd = String(today.getDate()).padStart(2, "0");
      var mm = String(today.getMonth() + 1).padStart(2, "0"); //January is 0!
      var yyyy = today.getFullYear();

      today = mm + "/" + dd + "/" + yyyy;
      document.write(today);
      ```

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

133. ### How do you compare two date objects

      You need to use date.getTime() method in order to compare unix timestamp values

      ```javascript
      var d1 = new Date();
      var d2 = new Date(d1);
      console.log(d1.getTime() === d2.getTime()); //True
      console.log(d1 === d2); // False
      ```

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

134. ### How do you check if a string starts with another string

      You can use ECMAScript 6's `String.prototype.startsWith()` method to check if a string starts with another string or not. But it is not yet supported in all browsers. Let's see an example to see this usage,

      ```javascript
      "Good morning".startsWith("Good"); // true
      "Good morning".startsWith("morning"); // false
      ```

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

135. ### How do you trim a string in javascript

      JavaScript provided a trim method on string types to trim any whitespaces present at the beginning or ending of the string.

      ```javascript
      "  Hello World   ".trim(); //Hello World
      ```

      If your browser(<IE9) doesn't support this method then you can use below polyfill.

      ```javascript
      if (!String.prototype.trim) {
        (function () {
          // Make sure we trim BOM and NBSP
          var rtrim = /^[\s\uFEFF\xA0]+|[\s\uFEFF\xA0]+$/g;
          String.prototype.trim = function () {
            return this.replace(rtrim, "");
          };
        })();
      }
      ```

136. ### How do you add a key value pair in javascript

      There are two possible solutions to add new properties to an object.

      Let's take a simple object to explain these solutions.

      ```javascript
      var object = {
        key1: value1,
        key2: value2,
      };
      ```

      1. **Using dot notation:** This solution is useful when you know the name of the property

      ```javascript
      object.key3 = "value3";
      ```

      2. **Using square bracket notation:** This solution is useful when the name of the property is dynamically determined or the key's name is non-JS like "user-name"

      ```javascript
      obj["key3"] = "value3";
      ```

137. ### Is the !-- notation represents a special operator

      No,that's not a special operator. But it is a combination of 2 standard operators one after the other,

      1. A logical not (!)
      2. A prefix decrement (--)

      At first, the value decremented by one and then tested to see if it is equal to zero or not for determining the truthy/falsy value.

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

138. ### How do you assign default values to variables

      You can use the logical or operator `||` in an assignment expression to provide a default value. The syntax looks like as below,

      ```javascript
      var a = b || c;
      ```

      As per the above expression, variable 'a 'will get the value of 'c' only if 'b' is falsy (if is null, false, undefined, 0, empty string, or NaN), otherwise 'a' will get the value of 'b'.

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

139. ### How do you define multiline strings

      You can define multiline string literals using the '\n' character followed by line terminator('\').

      ```javascript
      var str = "This is a \n very lengthy \n sentence!";
      console.log(str);
      ```

      But if you have a space after the '\n' character, there will be indentation inconsistencies.

140. ### What is an app shell model

      An application shell (or app shell) architecture is one way to build a Progressive Web App that reliably and instantly loads on your users' screens, similar to what you see in native applications. It is useful for getting some initial HTML to the screen fast without a network.

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

141. ### Can we define properties for functions

      Yes, we can define properties for functions because functions are also objects.

      ```javascript
      fn = function (x) {
        //Function code goes here
      };

      fn.name = "John";

      fn.profile = function (y) {
        //Profile code goes here
      };

      You can use `function.length` syntax to find the number of parameters expected by a function. Let's take an example of `sum` function to calculate the sum of numbers,

      ```javascript
      function sum(num1, num2, num3, num4) {
        return num1 + num2 + num3 + num4;
      }
      sum.length; // 4 is the number of parameters expected.
      ```

143. ### What is a polyfill

      A polyfill is a piece of JS code used to provide modern functionality on older browsers that do not natively support it. For example, Silverlight plugin polyfill can be used to mimic the functionality of an HTML Canvas element on Microsoft Internet Explorer 7.

      There are two main polyfill libraries available,

      1. **Core.js**: It is a modular javascript library used for cutting-edge ECMAScript features.
      2. **Polyfill.io:** It provides polyfills that are required for browser needs.

144. ### What are break and continue statements

      The break statement is used to "jump out" of a loop. i.e, It breaks the loop and continues executing the code after the loop.

      ```javascript
      for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        if (i === 5) {
          break;
        }
        text += "Number: " + i + "<br>";
      }
      ```

      The continue statement is used to "jump over" one iteration in the loop. i.e, It breaks one iteration (in the loop), if a specified condition occurs, and continues with the next iteration in the loop.

      ```javascript
      for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        if (i === 5) {
          continue;
        }
        text += "Number: " + i + "<br>";
      }
      ```

145. ### What are js labels

      The label statement allows us to name loops and blocks in JavaScript. We can then use these labels to refer back to the code later. For example, the below code with labels avoids printing the numbers when they are same,

      ```javascript
      var i, j;

      loop1: for (i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
        loop2: for (j = 0; j < 3; j++) {
          if (i === j) {
            continue loop1;
          }
          console.log("i = " + i + ", j = " + j);
        }
      }

      // Output is:
      //   "i = 1, j = 0"
      //   "i = 2, j = 0"
      //   "i = 2, j = 1"
      ```

146. ### What are the benefits of keeping declarations at the top

      It is recommended to keep all declarations at the top of each script or function. The benefits of doing this are,

      1. Gives cleaner code
      2. It provides a single place to look for local variables
      3. Easy to avoid unwanted global variables
      4. It reduces the possibility of unwanted re-declarations

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

147. ### What are the benefits of initializing variables

      It is recommended to initialize variables because of the below benefits,

      1. It gives cleaner code
      2. It provides a single place to initialize variables
      3. Avoid undefined values in the code

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

148. ### What are the recommendations to create new object

      It is recommended to avoid creating new objects using `new Object()`. Instead you can initialize values based on it's type to create the objects.

      1. Assign {} instead of new Object()
      2. Assign "" instead of new String()
      3. Assign 0 instead of new Number()
      4. Assign false instead of new Boolean()
      5. Assign [] instead of new Array()
      6. Assign /()/ instead of new RegExp()
      7. Assign function (){} instead of new Function()

      You can define them as an example,

      ```javascript
      var v1 = {};
      var v2 = "";
      var v3 = 0;
      var v4 = false;
      var v5 = [];
      var v6 = /()/;
      var v7 = function () {};
      ```

149. ### How do you define JSON arrays

      JSON arrays are written inside square brackets and arrays contain javascript objects. For example, the JSON array of users would be as below,

      ```javascript
      "users":[
        {"firstName":"John", "lastName":"Abrahm"},
        {"firstName":"Anna", "lastName":"Smith"},
        {"firstName":"Shane", "lastName":"Warn"}
      ]
      ```

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

150. ### How do you generate random integers

      You can use `Math.random()` with `Math.floor()` to return random integers. For example, if you want generate random integers between 1 to 10, the multiplication factor should be 10,

      ```javascript
      Math.floor(Math.random() * 10) + 1; // returns a random integer from 1 to 10
      Math.floor(Math.random() * 100) + 1; // returns a random integer from 1 to 100
      ```

      **Note:** `Math.random()` returns a random number between 0 (inclusive), and 1 (exclusive)

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

151. ### Can you write a random integers function to print integers within a range

      Yes, you can create a proper random function to return a random number between min and max (both included)

      ```javascript
      function randomInteger(min, max) {
        return Math.floor(Math.random() * (max - min + 1)) + min;
      }
      randomInteger(1, 100); // returns a random integer from 1 to 100
      randomInteger(1, 1000); // returns a random integer from 1 to 1000
      ```

152. ### What is tree shaking

      Tree shaking is a form of dead code elimination. It means that unused modules will not be included in the bundle during the build process and for that it relies on the static structure of ES2015 module syntax,( i.e. import and export). Initially this has been popularized by the ES2015 module bundler `rollup`, these days practically all bundlers use this technique.

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

153. ### What is the need of tree shaking

      Tree Shaking can significantly reduce the code size in any application. i.e, The less code we send over the wire the more performant the application will be. For example, if we just want to create a “Hello World” Application using SPA frameworks then it will take around a few MBs, but by tree shaking it can bring down the size to just a few hundred KBs. Tree shaking is implemented in Rollup and Webpack bundlers.

154. ### Is it recommended to use eval

      No, it allows arbitrary code to be run which causes a security problem. As we know that the eval() function is used to run text as code. In most of the cases, it should not be necessary to use it.

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

155. ### What is a Regular Expression

      A regular expression is a sequence of characters that forms a search pattern. You can use this search pattern for searching data in a text. These can be used to perform all types of text search and text replace operations. Let's see the syntax format now,

      ```javascript
      /pattern/modifiers;
      ```

      For example, the regular expression or search pattern with case-insensitive username would be,

      ```javascript
      /John/i;
      ```

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

156. ### What are the string methods that accept Regular expression

      There are six string methods: `search()`, `replace()`, `replaceAll()`, `match()`, `matchAll()`, and `split()`.

      The `search()` method uses an expression to search for a match, and returns the position of the match.

      ```javascript
      var msg = "Hello John";
      var n = msg.search(/John/i); // 6
      ```

      The `replace()` and `replaceAll()` methods are used to return a modified string where the pattern is replaced.

      ```javascript
      var msg = "ball bat";
      var n1 = msg.replace(/b/i, "c"); // call bat
      var n2 = msg.replaceAll(/b/i, "c"); // call cat
      ```

      The `match()` and `matchAll()` methods are used to return the matches when matching a string against a regular expression.

      ```javascript
      var msg = "Hello John";
      var n1 = msg.match(/[A-Z]/g); // ["H", "J"]
      var n2 = msg.matchAll(/[A-Z]/g); // this returns an iterator
      ```

      The `split()` method is used to split a string into an array of substrings, and returns the new array.

      ```javascript
      var msg = "Hello John";
      var n = msg.split(/\s/); // ["Hello", "John"]
      ```

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

157. ### What are modifiers in regular expression

      Modifiers can be used to perform case-insensitive and global searches. Let's list some of the modifiers,

      | Modifier | Description                                             |
      | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
      | i        | Perform case-insensitive matching                       |
      | g        | Perform a global match rather than stops at first match |
      | m        | Perform multiline matching                              |

      Let's take an example of global modifier,

      ```javascript
      var text = "Learn JS one by one";
      var pattern = /one/g;
      var result = text.match(pattern); // one,one
      ```

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

158. ### What are regular expression patterns

      Regular Expressions provide a group of patterns in order to match characters. Basically they are categorized into 3 types,

      1. **Brackets:** These are used to find a range of characters.
         For example, below are some use cases,
         1. [abc]: Used to find any of the characters between the brackets(a,b,c)
         2. [0-9]: Used to find any of the digits between the brackets
         3. (a|b): Used to find any of the alternatives separated with |
      2. **Metacharacters:** These are characters with a special meaning.
         For example, below are some use cases,
         1. \\d: Used to find a digit
         2. \\s: Used to find a whitespace character
         3. \\b: Used to find a match at the beginning or ending of a word
      3. **Quantifiers:** These are useful to define quantities.
         For example, below are some use cases,
         1. n+: Used to find matches for any string that contains at least one n
         2. n\*: Used to find matches for any string that contains zero or more occurrences of n
         3. n?: Used to find matches for any string that contains zero or one occurrences of n

159. ### What is a RegExp object

      RegExp object is a regular expression object with predefined properties and methods. Let's see the simple usage of RegExp object,

      ```javascript
      var regexp = new RegExp("\\w+");
      console.log(regexp);
      // expected output: /\w+/
      ```

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

160. ### How do you search a string for a pattern

      You can use the `test()` method of regular expression in order to search a string for a pattern, and return true or false depending on the result.

      ```javascript
      var pattern = /you/;
      console.log(pattern.test("How are you?")); //true
      ```

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

161. ### What is the purpose of exec method

      The purpose of exec method is similar to test method but it executes a search for a match in a specified string and returns a result array, or null instead of returning true/false.

      ```javascript
      var pattern = /you/;
      console.log(pattern.exec("How are you?")); //["you", index: 8, input: "How are you?", groups: undefined]
      ```

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

162. ### How do you change the style of a HTML element

      You can change inline style or classname of a HTML element using javascript DOM-manipulation

      1. **Using style property:** You can modify inline style using style property

      ```javascript
      document.getElementById("title").style.fontSize = "30px";
      ```

      2. **Using ClassName property:** It is easy to modify element class using className property

      ```javascript
      document.getElementById("title").className = "custom-title";
      ```

163. ### What would be the result of 1+2+'3'

      The output is going to be `33`. Since `1` and `2` are numeric values, the result of the first two digits is going to be a numeric value `3`. The next digit is a string type value because of that the addition of numeric value `3` and string type value `3` is just going to be a concatenation value `33`. Other operationrs like `3 * '3'` do yield correct results because the string is coerced into a number.

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

164. ### What is a debugger statement

      The debugger statement invokes any available debugging functionality, such as setting a breakpoint. If no debugging functionality is available, this statement has no effect.
      For example, in the below function a debugger statement has been inserted. So
      execution is paused at the debugger statement just like a breakpoint in the script source.

      ```javascript
      function getProfile() {
        // code goes here
        debugger;
        // code goes here
      }
      ```

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

165. ### What is the purpose of breakpoints in debugging

      You can set breakpoints in the javascript code once the debugger statement is executed and the debugger window pops up. At each breakpoint, javascript will stop executing, and let you examine the JavaScript values. After examining values, you can resume the execution of code using the play button.

166. ### Can I use reserved words as identifiers

      No, you cannot use the reserved words as variables, labels, object or function names. Let's see one simple example,

      ```javascript
      var else = "hello"; // Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token else
      ```

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

167. ### How do you detect a mobile browser

      You can use regex which returns a true or false value depending on whether or not the user is browsing with a mobile.

      ```javascript
      window.mobilecheck = function () {
        var mobileCheck = false;
        (function (a) {
          if (

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

168. ### How do you detect a mobile browser without regexp

      You can detect mobile browsers by simply running through a list of devices and checking if the useragent matches anything. This is an alternative solution for RegExp usage,

      ```javascript
      function detectmob() {
        if (
          navigator.userAgent.match(/Android/i) ||
          navigator.userAgent.match(/webOS/i) ||
          navigator.userAgent.match(/iPhone/i) ||
          navigator.userAgent.match(/iPad/i) ||
          navigator.userAgent.match(/iPod/i) ||
          navigator.userAgent.match(/BlackBerry/i) ||
          navigator.userAgent.match(/Windows Phone/i)
        ) {
          return true;
        } else {
          return false;
        }
      }
      ```

      You can programmatically get the image and check the dimensions(width and height) using Javascript.

      ```javascript
      var img = new Image();
      img.onload = function () {
        console.log(this.width + "x" + this.height);
      };
      img.src = "http://www.google.com/intl/en_ALL/images/logo.gif";
      ```

170. ### How do you make synchronous HTTP request

      Browsers provide an XMLHttpRequest object which can be used to make synchronous HTTP requests from JavaScript.

      ```javascript
      function httpGet(theUrl) {
        var xmlHttpReq = new XMLHttpRequest();
        xmlHttpReq.open("GET", theUrl, false); // false for synchronous request
        xmlHttpReq.send(null);
        return xmlHttpReq.responseText;
      }
      ```

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

171. ### How do you make asynchronous HTTP request

      Browsers provide an XMLHttpRequest object which can be used to make asynchronous HTTP requests from JavaScript by passing the 3rd parameter as true.

      ```javascript
      function httpGetAsync(theUrl, callback) {
        var xmlHttpReq = new XMLHttpRequest();
        xmlHttpReq.onreadystatechange = function () {
          if (xmlHttpReq.readyState == 4 && xmlHttpReq.status == 200)
            callback(xmlHttpReq.responseText);
        };
        xmlHttpReq.open("GET", theUrl, true); // true for asynchronous
        xmlHttpReq.send(null);
      }
      ```

      Today this is considered deprecated, because an async `fetch` call (in browsers later than 2016) is simpler and more robust.

172. ### How do you convert date to another timezone in javascript

      You can use the toLocaleString() method to convert dates in one timezone to another. For example, let's convert current date to British English timezone as below,

      ```javascript
      console.log(new Date().toLocaleString("en-GB", { timeZone: "UTC" })); //29/06/2019, 09:56:00
      ```

173. ### What are the properties used to get size of window

      You can use innerWidth, innerHeight, clientWidth, clientHeight properties of windows, document element and document body objects to find the size of a window. Let's use them combination of these properties to calculate the size of a window or document,

      ```javascript
      var width =
        window.innerWidth ||
        document.documentElement.clientWidth ||
        document.body.clientWidth;

      var height =
        window.innerHeight ||
        document.documentElement.clientHeight ||
        document.body.clientHeight;
      ```

174. ### What is a conditional operator in javascript

      The conditional (ternary) operator is the only JavaScript operator that takes three operands which acts as a shortcut for `if` statements.

      ```javascript
      var isAuthenticated = false;
      console.log(
        isAuthenticated ? "Hello, welcome" : "Sorry, you are not authenticated"
      ); // Sorry, you are not authenticated
      ```

175. ### Can you apply chaining on conditional operator

      Yes, you can apply chaining on conditional operators similar to **`if … else if … else if … else`** chain. The syntax is going to be as below,

      ```javascript
      function traceValue(someParam) {
        return condition1
          ? value1
          : condition2
          ? value2
          : condition3
          ? value3
          : value4;
      }

      // The above conditional operator is equivalent to:

      function traceValue(someParam) {
        if (condition1) {
          return value1;
        } else if (condition2) {
          return value2;
        } else if (condition3) {
          return value3;
        } else {
          return value4;
        }
      }
      ```

176. ### What are the ways to execute javascript after a page load

      You can execute javascript after page load in many different ways,

      1. **window.onload:**

      ```javascript
      window.onload = function ...
      ```

      2. **document.onload:**

      ```javascript
      document.onload = function ...
      ```

      3. **body onload:**

      ```javascript
      <body onload="script();">
      ```

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

177. ### What is the difference between proto and prototype

      The `__proto__` object is the actual object that is used in the lookup chain to resolve methods, etc. Whereas `prototype` is the object that is used to build `__proto__` when you create an object with the `new` operator (a special variant of a function call).

      ```javascript
      new Employee().__proto__ === Employee.prototype;
      new Employee().prototype === undefined;
      ```

      There are few more differences,

      | feature    | Prototype                                                    | proto                                                      |
      | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
      | Access     | All function constructors have prototype properties.         | All objects have \_\_proto\_\_ property                    |
      | Purpose    | Used to reduce memory wastage with a single copy of function | Used in lookup chain to resolve methods, constructors etc. |
      | ECMAScript | Introduced in ES6                                            | Introduced in ES5                                          |
      | Usage      | Frequently used                                              | Rarely used                                                |

178. ### Can you give an example of when you really need a semicolon

      It is recommended to use semicolons after every statement in JavaScript. For example, in the below case (that is an IIFE = Immediately Invoked Function Expression) it throws an error ".. is not a function" at runtime due to missing semicolon.

      ```javascript
      // define a function
      var fn = (function () {
        //...
      })(
        // semicolon missing at this line

        // then execute some code inside a closure
        function () {
          //...
        }
      )();
      ```

      and it will be interpreted as

      ```javascript
      var fn = (function () {
        //...
      })(function () {
        //...
      })();
      ```

      In this case, we are passing the second function as an argument to the first function and then trying to call the result of the first function call as a function. Hence, the second function will fail with a "... is not a function" error at runtime.

179. ### What is the freeze method

      The **`freeze()`** method is used to freeze an object. Freezing an object does not allow adding new properties to an object, prevents removing, and prevents changing the enumerability, configurability, or writability of existing properties. i.e. It returns the passed object and does not create a frozen copy.

      ```javascript
      const obj = {
        prop: 100,
      };

      Object.freeze(obj);
      obj.prop = 200; // Throws an error in strict mode

      console.log(obj.prop); //100
      ```

      Remember freezing is only applied to the top-level properties in objects but not for nested objects.
      For example, let's try to freeze user object which has employment details as nested object and observe that details have been changed.

      ```javascript
      const user = {
        name: "John",
        employment: {
          department: "IT",
        },
      };

      Object.freeze(user);
      user.employment.department = "HR";
      ```

      **Note:** It causes a TypeError if the argument passed is not an object.

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

180. ### What is the purpose of the freeze method

      Below are the main benefits of using freeze method,

      1. It is used for freezing objects and arrays.
      2. It is used to make an object immutable.

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

181. ### Why do I need to use the freeze method

      In the Object-oriented paradigm, an existing API contains certain elements that are not intended to be extended, modified, or re-used outside of their current context. Hence it works as the `final` keyword which is used in various languages.

182. ### How do you detect a browser language preference

      You can use the navigator object to detect a browser language preference as below,

      ```javascript
      var language =
        (navigator.languages && navigator.languages[0]) || // Chrome / Firefox
        navigator.language || // All browsers
        navigator.userLanguage; // IE <= 10

      console.log(language);
      ```

183. ### How to convert a string to title case with javascript

      Title case means that the first letter of each word is capitalized. You can convert a string to title case using the below function,

      ```javascript
      function toTitleCase(str) {
        return str.replace(/\w\S*/g, function (txt) {
          return txt.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + txt.substring(1).toLowerCase();
        });
      }
      toTitleCase("good morning john"); // Good Morning John
      ```

184. ### How do you detect if javascript is disabled on the page

      You can use the `<noscript>` tag to detect javascript disabled or not. The code block inside `<noscript>` gets executed when JavaScript is disabled, and is typically used to display alternative content when the page generated in JavaScript.

      ```javascript
      <script type="javascript">
          // JS related code goes here
      </script>
      <noscript>
          <a href="next_page.html?noJS=true">JavaScript is disabled in the page. Please click Next Page</a>
      </noscript>
      ```

185. ### What are various operators supported by javascript

      An operator is capable of manipulating(mathematical and logical computations) a certain value or operand. There are various operators supported by JavaScript as below,

      1. **Arithmetic Operators:** Includes + (Addition), – (Subtraction), \* (Multiplication), / (Division), % (Modulus), ++ (Increment) and – – (Decrement)
      2. **Comparison Operators:** Includes == (Equal), != (Not Equal), === (Equal with type), > (Greater than), >= (Greater than or Equal to), < (Less than), <= (Less than or Equal to)
      3. **Logical Operators:** Includes && (Logical AND), || (Logical OR), ! (Logical NOT)
      4. **Assignment Operators:** Includes = (Assignment Operator), += (Add and Assignment Operator), –= (Subtract and Assignment Operator), \*= (Multiply and Assignment), /= (Divide and Assignment), %= (Modules and Assignment)
      5. **Ternary Operators:** It includes conditional(: ?) Operator
      6. **typeof Operator:** It uses to find type of variable. The syntax looks like `typeof variable`

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

186. ### What is a rest parameter

      Rest parameter is an improved way to handle function parameters which allows us to represent an indefinite number of arguments as an array. The syntax would be as below,

      ```javascript
      function f(a, b, ...theArgs) {
        // ...
      }
      ```

      For example, let's take a sum example to calculate on dynamic number of parameters,

      ```javascript
      function sum(...args) {
        let total = 0;
        for (const i of args) {
          total += i;
        }
        return total;
      }

      console.log(sum(1, 2)); //3
      console.log(sum(1, 2, 3)); //6
      console.log(sum(1, 2, 3, 4)); //10
      console.log(sum(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)); //15
      ```

      **Note:** Rest parameter is added in ES2015 or ES6

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

187. ### What happens if you do not use rest parameter as a last argument

      The rest parameter should be the last argument, as its job is to collect all the remaining arguments into an array. For example, if you define a function like below it doesn’t make any sense and will throw an error.

      ```javascript
      function someFunc(a,…b,c){
      //You code goes here
      return;
      }
      ```

188. ### What are the bitwise operators available in javascript

      Below are the list of bitwise logical operators used in JavaScript

      1. Bitwise AND ( & )
      2. Bitwise OR ( | )
      3. Bitwise XOR ( ^ )
      4. Bitwise NOT ( ~ )
      5. Left Shift ( << )
      6. Sign Propagating Right Shift ( >> )
      7. Zero fill Right Shift ( >>> )

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

189. ### What is a spread operator

      Spread operator allows iterables( arrays / objects / strings ) to be expanded into single arguments/elements. Let's take an example to see this behavior,

      ```javascript
      function calculateSum(x, y, z) {
        return x + y + z;
      }

      const numbers = [1, 2, 3];

      console.log(calculateSum(...numbers)); // 6
      ```

190. ### How do you determine whether object is frozen or not

      `Object.isFrozen()` method is used to determine if an object is frozen or not.An object is frozen if all of the below conditions hold true,

      1. If it is not extensible.
      2. If all of its properties are non-configurable.
      3. If all its data properties are non-writable.
         The usage is going to be as follows,

      ```javascript
      const object = {
        property: "Welcome JS world",
      };
      Object.freeze(object);
      console.log(Object.isFrozen(object));
      ```

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

191. ### How do you determine two values same or not using object

      The `Object.is()` method determines whether two values are the same value. For example, the usage with different types of values would be,

      ```javascript
      Object.is("hello", "hello"); // true
      Object.is(window, window); // true
      Object.is([], []); // false
      ```

      Two values are considered identical if one of the following holds:

      1. both undefined
      2. both null
      3. both true or both false
      4. both strings of the same length with the same characters in the same order
      5. both the same object (means both object have same reference)
      6. both numbers and
         both +0
         both -0
         both NaN
         both non-zero and both not NaN and both have the same value.

192. ### What is the purpose of using object is method

      Some of the applications of Object's `is` method are follows,

      1. It is used for comparison of two strings.
      2. It is used for comparison of two numbers.
      3. It is used for comparing the polarity of two numbers.
      4. It is used for comparison of two objects.

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

193. ### How do you copy properties from one object to other

      You can use the `Object.assign()` method which is used to copy the values and properties from one or more source objects to a target object. It returns the target object which has properties and values copied from the source objects. The syntax would be as below,

      ```javascript
      Object.assign(target, ...sources);
      ```

      Let's take example with one source and one target object,

      ```javascript
      const target = { a: 1, b: 2 };
      const source = { b: 3, c: 4 };

      const returnedTarget = Object.assign(target, source);

      console.log(target); // { a: 1, b: 3, c: 4 }

      console.log(returnedTarget); // { a: 1, b: 3, c: 4 }
      ```

      As observed in the above code, there is a common property(`b`) from source to target so it's value has been overwritten.

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

194. ### What are the applications of the assign method

      Below are the some of main applications of `Object.assign()` method,

      1. It is used for cloning an object.
      2. It is used to merge objects with the same properties.

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

195. ### What is a proxy object

      The Proxy object is used to define custom behavior for fundamental operations such as property lookup, assignment, enumeration, function invocation, etc.

      A proxy is created with two parameters: a target object which you want to proxy and a handler object which contains methods to intercept fundamental operations. The syntax would be as follows,

      ```javascript
      var p = new Proxy(target, handler);
      ```

      Let's take a look at below examples of proxy object and how the get method which customize the lookup behavior,

      ```javascript
      //Example1:

      const person = {
        name: "Sudheer Jonna",
        age: 35,
      };

      const handler = {
        get(target, prop) {
          if (prop === "name") {
            return "Mr. " + target[prop];
          }
          return target[prop];
        },
      };

      const proxy = new Proxy(person, handler);

      //Example2:

      var handler1 = {
        get: function (obj, prop) {
          return prop in obj ? obj[prop] : 100;
        },
      };

      var p = new Proxy({}, handler1);
      p.a = 10;
      p.b = null;

      console.log(p.a, p.b); // 10, null
      console.log("c" in p, p.c); // false, 100
      ```

      In the above code, it uses `get` handler which define the behavior of the proxy when an operation is performed on it. These proxies are mainly used for some of the below cross-cutting concerns.

      1. Logging
      2. Authentication or Authorization
      3. Data binding and observables
      4. Function parameter validation

      **Note:** This feature was introduced with ES6.

196. ### What is the purpose of the seal method

      The `Object.seal()` method is used to seal an object, by preventing new properties from being added to it and marking all existing properties as non-configurable. But **values of present properties can still be changed as long as they are writable**. The next level of immutability would be the [`Object.freeze()`](#what-is-a-freeze-method) method. Let's see the below example to understand more about `seal()` method

      ```javascript
      const object = {
        property: "Welcome JS world",
      };
      Object.seal(object);
      object.property = "Welcome to object world";
      console.log(Object.isSealed(object)); // true
      delete object.property; // You cannot delete when sealed
      console.log(object.property); //Welcome to object world
      ```

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

197. ### What are the applications of the seal method

      Below are the main applications of `Object.seal()` method,

      1. It is used for sealing objects and arrays.
      2. It is used to make properties of an object non-configurable.

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

198. ### What are the differences between the freeze and seal methods

      If an object is frozen using the `Object.freeze()` method then its properties become immutable and no changes can be made in them whereas if an object is sealed using the `Object.seal()` method then the changes can be made in the existing properties of the object.

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

199. ### How do you determine if an object is sealed or not

      The `Object.isSealed()` method is used to determine if an object is sealed or not. An object is sealed if all of the below conditions hold true

      1. If it is not extensible.
      2. If all of its properties are non-configurable.
      3. If it is not removable (but not necessarily non-writable).
         Let's see it in the action

      ```javascript
      const object = {
        property: "Hello, Good morning",
      };

      Object.seal(object); // Using seal() method to seal the object

      console.log(Object.isSealed(object)); // checking whether the object is sealed or not
      ```

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

200. ### How do you get enumerable key and value pairs

      The `Object.entries()` method is used to return an array of a given object's own enumerable string-keyed property [key, value] pairs, in the same order as that provided by a `for...in` loop. Let's see the functionality of `object.entries()` method in an example,

      ```javascript
      const object = {
        a: "Good morning",
        b: 100,
      };

      for (let [key, value] of Object.entries(object)) {
        console.log(`${key}: ${value}`); // a: 'Good morning'
        // b: 100
      }
      ```

      **Note:** The order is not guaranteed as object defined.

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

201. ### What is the main difference between Object.values and Object.entries method

      The `Object.values()` method's behavior is similar to `Object.entries()` method but it returns an array of values instead [key,value] pairs.

      ```javascript
      const object = {
        a: "Good morning",
        b: 100,
      };

      for (let value of Object.values(object)) {
        console.log(`${value}`); // 'Good morning \n100'
      }
      ```

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

202. ### How can you get the list of keys of any object

      You can use the `Object.keys()` method which is used to return an array of a given object's own property names, in the same order as we get with a normal loop. For example, you can get the keys of a user object,

      ```javascript
      const user = {
        name: "John",
        gender: "male",
        age: 40,
      };

      console.log(Object.keys(user)); //['name', 'gender', 'age']
      ```

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

203. ### How do you create an object with a prototype

      The `Object.create()` method is used to create a new object with the specified prototype object and properties. i.e, It uses an existing object as the prototype of the newly created object. It returns a new object with the specified prototype object and properties.

      ```javascript
      const user = {
        name: "John",
        printInfo: function () {
          console.log(`My name is ${this.name}.`);
        },
      };

      const admin = Object.create(user);

      admin.name = "Nick"; // Remember that "name" is a property set on "admin" but not on "user" object

      admin.printInfo(); // My name is Nick
      ```

204. ### What is a WeakSet

      A `WeakSet` is used to store a collection of weakly(weak references) held objects. The syntax would be as follows,

      ```javascript
      new WeakSet([iterable]);
      ```

      Let's see the below example to explain it's behavior,

      ```javascript
      var ws = new WeakSet();
      var user = {};
      ws.add(user);
      ws.has(user); // true
      ws.delete(user); // removes user from the set
      ws.has(user); // false, user has been removed
      ```

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

205. ### What are the differences between WeakSet and Set

      The main difference is that references to objects in `Set` are strong while references to objects in `WeakSet` are weak. i.e, An object in `WeakSet` can be garbage collected if there is no other reference to it.
      Other differences are:

      1. `Set` can store any value whereas `WeakSet` can store only collections of objects
      2. `WeakSet` does not have size property unlike `Set`
      3. `WeakSet` does not have methods such as clear, keys, values, entries, forEach.
      4. `WeakSet` is not iterable.

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

206. ### List down the collection of methods available on WeakSet

      Below are the list of methods available on `WeakSet`,

      1. `add(value)`: A new object is appended with the given value
      2. `delete(value)`: Deletes the value from the collection.
      3. `has(value)`: It returns true if the value is present in the collection, otherwise it returns false.

      Let's see the functionality of all the above methods in an example,

      ```javascript
      var weakSetObject = new WeakSet();
      var firstObject = {};
      var secondObject = {};
      // add(value)
      weakSetObject.add(firstObject);
      weakSetObject.add(secondObject);
      console.log(weakSetObject.has(firstObject)); //true
      weakSetObject.delete(secondObject);
      ```

207. ### What is a WeakMap

      A `WeakMap` object is a collection of key/value pairs in which the keys are weakly referenced. In this case, keys must be objects and the values can be arbitrary values. The syntax looks like the following:

      ```javascript
      new WeakMap([iterable]);
      ```

      Let's see the below example to explain it's behavior,

      ```javascript
      var ws = new WeakMap();
      var user = {};
      ws.set(user);
      ws.has(user); // true
      ws.delete(user); // removes user from the map
      ws.has(user); // false, user has been removed
      ```

208. ### What are the differences between WeakMap and Map

      The main difference is that references to key objects in `Map` are strong while references to key objects in `WeakMap` are weak. i.e, A key object in `WeakMap` can be garbage collected if there is no other reference to it.
      Other differences are,

      1. `Map` can store any key type whereas `WeakMap` can store only collections of key objects
      2. `WeakMap` does not have size property unlike `Map`
      3. `WeakMap` does not have methods such as clear, keys, values, entries, forEach.
      4. `WeakMap` is not iterable.

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

209. ### List down the collection of methods available on WeakMap

      Below are the list of methods available on `WeakMap`,

      1. `set(key, value)`: Sets the value for the key in the `WeakMap` object. Returns the `WeakMap` object.
      2. `delete(key)`: Removes any value associated to the key.
      3. `has(key)`: Returns a Boolean asserting whether a value has been associated to the key in the `WeakMap` object or not.
      4. `get(key)`: Returns the value associated to the key, or undefined if there is none.
         Let's see the functionality of all the above methods in an example,

      ```javascript
      var weakMapObject = new WeakMap();
      var firstObject = {};
      var secondObject = {};
      // set(key, value)
      weakMapObject.set(firstObject, "John");
      weakMapObject.set(secondObject, 100);
      console.log(weakMapObject.has(firstObject)); //true
      console.log(weakMapObject.get(firstObject)); // John
      weakMapObject.delete(secondObject);
      ```

210. ### What is the purpose of uneval

      The `uneval()` is an builtin function which is used to create a string representation of the source code of an Object. It is a top-level function and is not associated with any object. Let's see the below example to know more about it's functionality,

      ```javascript
      var a = 1;
      uneval(a); // returns a String containing 1
      uneval(function user() {}); // returns "(function user(){})"
      ```

      The `uneval()` function has been deprecated. It is recommended to use `toString()` for functions and `JSON.stringify()` for other cases.

      ```javascript
      function user() {}
      console.log(user.toString()); // returns "(function user(){})"
      ```

211. ### How do you encode an URL

      The `encodeURI()` function is used to encode complete URI which has special characters except (, / ? : @ & = + $ #) characters.

      ```javascript
      var uri = "https://mozilla.org/?x=шеллы";
      var encoded = encodeURI(uri);
      console.log(encoded); // https://mozilla.org/?x=%D1%88%D0%B5%D0%BB%D0%BB%D1%8B
      ```

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

212. ### How do you decode an URL

      The `decodeURI()` function is used to decode a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) previously created by `encodeURI()`.

      ```javascript
      var uri = "https://mozilla.org/?x=шеллы";
      var encoded = encodeURI(uri);
      console.log(encoded); // https://mozilla.org/?x=%D1%88%D0%B5%D0%BB%D0%BB%D1%8B
      try {
        console.log(decodeURI(encoded)); // "https://mozilla.org/?x=шеллы"
      } catch (e) {
        // catches a malformed URI
        console.error(e);
      }
      ```

213. ### How do you print the contents of web page

      The `window` object provides a `print()` method which is used to print the contents of the current window. It opens a Print dialog box which lets you choose between various printing options. Let's see the usage of print method in an example,

      ```html
      <input type="button" value="Print" onclick="window.print()" />
      ```

      **Note:** In most browsers, it will block while the print dialog is open.

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

214. ### What is the difference between uneval and eval

      The `uneval` function returns the source of a given object; whereas the `eval` function does the opposite, by evaluating that source code in a different memory area. Let's see an example to clarify the difference,

      ```javascript
      var msg = uneval(function greeting() {
        return "Hello, Good morning";
      });
      var greeting = eval(msg);
      greeting(); // returns "Hello, Good morning"
      ```

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

215. ### What is an anonymous function

      An anonymous function is a function without a name! Anonymous functions are commonly assigned to a variable name or used as a callback function. The syntax would be as below,

      ```javascript
      function (optionalParameters) {
        //do something
      }

      const myFunction = function(){ //Anonymous function assigned to a variable
        //do something
      };

      [1, 2, 3].map(function(element){ //Anonymous function used as a callback function
        //do something
      });
      ```

      Let's see the above anonymous function in an example,

      ```javascript
      var x = function (a, b) {
        return a * b;
      };
      var z = x(5, 10);
      console.log(z); // 50
      ```

216. ### What is the precedence order between local and global variables

      A local variable takes precedence over a global variable with the same name. Let's see this behavior in an example.

      ```javascript
      var msg = "Good morning";
      function greeting() {
        msg = "Good Evening";
        console.log(msg); // Good Evening
      }
      greeting();
      ```

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

217. ### What are javascript accessors

      ECMAScript 5 introduced javascript object accessors or computed properties through getters and setters. Getters uses the `get` keyword whereas Setters uses the `set` keyword.

      ```javascript
      var user = {
        firstName: "John",
        lastName: "Abraham",
        language: "en",
        get lang() {
          return this.language;
        },
        set lang(lang) {
          this.language = lang;
        },
      };
      console.log(user.lang); // getter access lang as en
      user.lang = "fr";
      console.log(user.lang); // setter used to set lang as fr
      ```

218. ### How do you define property on Object constructor

      The `Object.defineProperty()` static method is used to define a new property directly on an object, or modify an existing property on an object, and returns the object. Let's see an example to know how to define property,

      ```javascript
      const newObject = {};

      Object.defineProperty(newObject, "newProperty", {
        value: 100,
        writable: false,
      });

      console.log(newObject.newProperty); // 100

      newObject.newProperty = 200; // It throws an error in strict mode due to writable setting
      ```

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

219. ### What is the difference between get and defineProperty

      Both have similar results unless you use classes. If you use `get` the property will be defined on the prototype of the object whereas using `Object.defineProperty()` the property will be defined on the instance it is applied to.

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

220. ### What are the advantages of Getters and Setters

      Below are the list of benefits of Getters and Setters,

      1. They provide simpler syntax
      2. They are used for defining computed properties, or accessors in JS.
      3. Useful to provide equivalence relation between properties and methods
      4. They can provide better data quality
      5. Useful for doing things behind the scenes with the encapsulated logic.

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

221. ### Can I add getters and setters using defineProperty method

      Yes, You can use the `Object.defineProperty()` method to add Getters and Setters. For example, the below counter object uses increment, decrement, add and subtract properties,

      ```javascript
      var obj = { counter: 0 };

      // Define getters
      Object.defineProperty(obj, "increment", {
        get: function () {
          this.counter++;
          return this.counter;
        },
      });
      Object.defineProperty(obj, "decrement", {
        get: function () {
          this.counter--;
          return this.counter;
        },
      });

      // Define setters
      Object.defineProperty(obj, "add", {
        set: function (value) {
          this.counter += value;
        },
      });
      Object.defineProperty(obj, "subtract", {
        set: function (value) {
          this.counter -= value;
        },
      });

      obj.add = 10;
      obj.subtract = 5;
      console.log(obj.increment); //6
      console.log(obj.decrement); //5
      ```

222. ### What is the purpose of switch-case

      The `switch case` statement in JavaScript is used for decision making purposes. In a few cases, using the `switch case` statement is going to be more convenient than `if-else` statements. The syntax would be as below,

      ```javascript
      switch (expression)
      {
          case value1:
              statement1;
              break;
          case value2:
              statement2;
              break;
          .
          .
          case valueN:
              statementN;
              break;
          default:
              statementDefault;
      }
      ```

      The above multi-way branch statement provides an easy way to dispatch execution to different parts of code based on the value of the expression.

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

223. ### What are the conventions to be followed for the usage of switch case

      Below are the list of conventions should be taken care,

      1. The expression can be of type either number or string.
      2. Duplicate values are not allowed for the expression.
      3. The default statement is optional. If the expression passed to switch does not match with any case value then the statement within default case will be executed.
      4. The break statement is used inside the switch to terminate a statement sequence.
      5. The break statement is optional. But if it is omitted, the execution will continue on into the next case.

224. ### What are primitive data types

      A primitive data type is data that has a primitive value (which has no properties or methods). There are 7 types of primitive data types.

      1. string
      2. number
      3. boolean
      4. null
      5. undefined
      6. bigint
      7. symbol

225. ### What are the different ways to access object properties

      There are 3 possible ways for accessing the property of an object.

      1. **Dot notation:** It uses dot for accessing the properties

      ```javascript
      objectName.property;
      ```

      2. **Square brackets notation:** It uses square brackets for property access

      ```javascript
      objectName["property"];
      ```

      3. **Expression notation:** It uses expression in the square brackets

      ```javascript
      objectName[expression];
      ```

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

226. ### What are the function parameter rules

      JavaScript functions follow below rules for parameters,

      1. The function definitions do not specify data types for parameters.
      2. Do not perform type checking on the passed arguments.
      3. Do not check the number of arguments received.
         i.e, The below function follows the above rules,

      ```javascript
      function functionName(parameter1, parameter2, parameter3) {
        console.log(parameter1); // 1
      }
      functionName(1);
      ```

227. ### What is an error object

      An error object is a built in error object that provides error information when an error occurs. It has two properties: name and message. For example, the below function logs error details,

      ```javascript
      try {
        greeting("Welcome");
      } catch (err) {
        console.log(err.name + "<br>" + err.message);
      }
      ```

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

228. ### When do you get a syntax error

      A SyntaxError is thrown if you try to evaluate code with a syntax error. For example, the below missing quote for the function parameter throws a syntax error

      ```javascript
      try {
        eval("greeting('welcome)"); // Missing ' will produce an error
      } catch (err) {
        console.log(err.name);
      }
      ```

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

229. ### What are the different error names from error object

      There are 7 different types of error names returned from error object,
      | Error Name | Description |
      |---- | ---------
      | `AggregateError` | An error indicating that multiple errors occurred |
      | `EvalError` | An error has occurred in the eval() function |
      | `RangeError` | An error has occurred with a number "out of range" |
      | `ReferenceError` | An error due to an illegal reference|
      | `SyntaxError` | An error due to a syntax error|
      | `TypeError` | An error due to a type error |
      | `URIError` | An error due to encodeURI() |

230. ### What are the various statements in error handling

      Below are the list of statements used in an error handling,

      1. **try:** This statement is used to test a block of code for errors
      2. **catch:** This statement is used to handle the error
      3. **throw:** This statement is used to create custom errors.
      4. **finally:** This statement is used to execute code after try and catch regardless of the result.

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

231. ### What are the two types of loops in javascript

      1. **Entry Controlled loops:** In this kind of loop type, the test condition is tested before entering the loop body. For example, For Loop and While Loop comes under this category.
      2. **Exit Controlled Loops:** In this kind of loop type, the test condition is tested or evaluated at the end of the loop body. i.e, the loop body will execute at least once irrespective of test condition true or false. For example, do-while loop comes under this category.

233. ### What is the Intl object

      The `Intl` object is the namespace for the ECMAScript Internationalization API, which provides language sensitive string comparison, number formatting, and date and time formatting. It provides access to several constructors and language sensitive functions.

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

234. ### How do you perform language specific date and time formatting

      You can use the `Intl.DateTimeFormat` object which is a constructor for objects that enable language-sensitive date and time formatting. Let's see this behavior with an example,

      ```javascript
      var date = new Date(Date.UTC(2019, 07, 07, 3, 0, 0));
      console.log(new Intl.DateTimeFormat("en-GB").format(date)); // 07/08/2019
      console.log(new Intl.DateTimeFormat("en-AU").format(date)); // 07/08/2019
      ```

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

235. ### What is an Iterator

      An iterator is an object which defines a sequence and a return value upon its termination. It implements the Iterator protocol with a `next()` method which returns an object with two properties: `value` (the next value in the sequence) and `done` (which is true if the last value in the sequence has been consumed).

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

236. ### How does synchronous iteration works

      Synchronous iteration was introduced in ES6 and it works with below set of components,

      **Iterable:** It is an object which can be iterated over via a method whose key is Symbol.iterator.

      **Iterator:** It is an object returned by invoking `[Symbol.iterator]()` on an iterable. This iterator object wraps each iterated element in an object and returns it via `next()` method one by one.

      **IteratorResult:** It is an object returned by `next()` method. The object contains two properties; the `value` property contains an iterated element and the `done` property determines whether the element is the last element or not.

      Let's demonstrate synchronous iteration with an array as below

      ```javascript
      const iterable = ["one", "two", "three"];
      const iterator = iterable[Symbol.iterator]();
      console.log(iterator.next()); // { value: 'one', done: false }
      console.log(iterator.next()); // { value: 'two', done: false }
      console.log(iterator.next()); // { value: 'three', done: false }
      console.log(iterator.next()); // { value: 'undefined, done: true }
      ```

237. ### What is the event loop

      The event loop is a process that continuously monitors both the call stack and the event queue and checks whether or not the call stack is empty. If the call stack is empty and there are pending events in the event queue, the event loop dequeues the event from the event queue and pushes it to the call stack. The call stack executes the event, and any additional events generated during the execution are added to the end of the event queue.

      **Note:** The event loop allows Node.js to perform non-blocking I/O operations, even though JavaScript is single-threaded, by offloading operations to the system kernel whenever possible. Since most modern kernels are multi-threaded, they can handle multiple operations executing in the background.

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

238. ### What is the call stack

      Call Stack is a data structure for javascript interpreters to keep track of function calls(creates execution context) in the program. It has two major actions,

      1. Whenever you call a function for its execution, you are pushing it to the stack.
      2. Whenever the execution is completed, the function is popped out of the stack.

      Let's take an example and it's state representation in a diagram format

      ```javascript
      function hungry() {
        eatFruits();
      }
      function eatFruits() {
        return "I'm eating fruits";
      }

      // Invoke the `hungry` function
      hungry();
      ```

      The above code processed in a call stack as below,

      3. Add the `hungry()` function to the call stack list and execute the code.
      4. Add the `eatFruits()` function to the call stack list and execute the code.
      5. Delete the `eatFruits()` function from our call stack list.
      6. Delete the `hungry()` function from the call stack list since there are no items anymore.

239. ### What is the event queue

      The event queue follows the queue data structure. It stores async callbacks to be added to the call stack. It is also known as the Callback Queue or Macrotask Queue.

      Whenever the call stack receives an async function, it is moved into the Web API. Based on the function, Web API executes it and awaits the result. Once it is finished, it moves the callback into the event queue (the callback of a promise is moved into the microtask queue).

      The event loop constantly checks whether or not the call stack is empty. Once the call stack is empty and there is a callback in the event queue, the event loop moves the callback into the call stack. But if there is a callback in the microtask queue as well, it is moved first. The microtask queue has a higher priority than the event queue.

240. ### What is a decorator

      A decorator is an expression that evaluates to a function and that takes the target, name, and decorator descriptor as arguments. Also, it optionally returns a decorator descriptor to install on the target object. Let's define admin decorator for user class at design time,

      ```javascript
      function admin(isAdmin) {
         return function(target) {
             target.isAdmin = isAdmin;
         }
      }

      @admin(true)
      class User() {
      }
      console.log(User.isAdmin); //true

       @admin(false)
       class User() {
       }
       console.log(User.isAdmin); //false
      ```

241. ### What are the properties of the Intl object

      Below are the list of properties available on the `Intl` object,

      1. **Collator:** These are the objects that enable language-sensitive string comparison.
      2. **DateTimeFormat:** These are the objects that enable language-sensitive date and time formatting.
      3. **ListFormat:** These are the objects that enable language-sensitive list formatting.
      4. **NumberFormat:** Objects that enable language-sensitive number formatting.
      5. **PluralRules:** Objects that enable plural-sensitive formatting and language-specific rules for plurals.
      6. **RelativeTimeFormat:** Objects that enable language-sensitive relative time formatting.

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

242. ### What is an Unary operator

      The unary(+) operator is used to convert a variable to a number.If the variable cannot be converted, it will still become a number but with the value NaN. Let's see this behavior in an action.

      ```javascript
      var x = "100";
      var y = +x;
      console.log(typeof x, typeof y); // string, number

      var a = "Hello";
      var b = +a;
      console.log(typeof a, typeof b, b); // string, number, NaN
      ```

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

243. ### How do you sort elements in an array

      The `sort()` method is used to sort the elements of an array in place and returns the sorted array. The default sort order is ascending, based on the string Unicode order. The example usage would be as below,

      ```javascript
      var months = ["Aug", "Sep", "Jan", "June"];
      months.sort();
      console.log(months); //  ["Aug", "Jan", "June", "Sep"]
      ```

      **Beware:** `sort()` is changing the original array.

244. ### What is the purpose of compareFunction while sorting arrays

      The compareFunction is used to define the sort order. If omitted, the array elements are converted to strings, then sorted according to each character's Unicode code point value.

      Let's take an example to see the usage of compareFunction,

      ```javascript
      let numbers = [1, 2, 5, 3, 4];
      numbers.sort((a, b) => b - a);
      console.log(numbers); // [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
      ```

245. ### How do you reverse an array

      You can use the `reverse()` method to reverse the elements in an array. This method is useful to sort an array in descending order. Let's see the usage of `reverse()` method in an example,

      ```javascript
      let numbers = [1, 2, 5, 3, 4];
      numbers.sort((a, b) => b - a);
      numbers.reverse();
      console.log(numbers); // [1, 2, 3, 4 ,5]
      ```

246. ### How do you find the min and max values in an array

      You can use `Math.min` and `Math.max` methods on array variables to find the minimum and maximum elements within an array. Let's create two functions to find the min and max value with in an array,

      ```javascript
      var marks = [50, 20, 70, 60, 45, 30];
      function findMin(arr) {
        return Math.min.apply(null, arr);
      }
      function findMax(arr) {
        return Math.max.apply(null, arr);
      }

      console.log(findMin(marks));
      console.log(findMax(marks));
      ```

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

247. ### How do you find the min and max values without Math functions

      You can write functions which loop through an array comparing each value with the lowest value or highest value to find the min and max values. Let's create those functions to find min and max values,

      ```javascript
      var marks = [50, 20, 70, 60, 45, 30];
      function findMin(arr) {
        var length = arr.length;
        var min = Infinity;
        while (length--) {
          if (arr[length] < min) {
            min = arr[length];
          }
        }
        return min;
      }

      function findMax(arr) {
        var length = arr.length;
        var max = -Infinity;
        while (length--) {
          if (arr[length] > max) {
            max = arr[length];
          }
        }
        return max;
      }

      console.log(findMin(marks));
      console.log(findMax(marks));
      ```

248. ### What is an empty statement and purpose of it

      The empty statement is a semicolon (;) indicating that no statement will be executed, even if JavaScript syntax requires one. Since there is no action with an empty statement you might think that it's usage is quite less, but the empty statement is occasionally useful when you want to create a loop that has an empty body. For example, you can initialize an array with zero values as below,

      ```javascript
      // Initialize an array a
      for (let i = 0; i < a.length; a[i++] = 0);
      ```

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

249. ### How do you get the metadata of a module

      You can use the `import.meta` object which is a meta-property exposing context-specific meta data to a JavaScript module. It contains information about the current module, such as the module's URL. In browsers, you might get different meta data than NodeJS.

      ```javascript
      <script type="module" src="welcome-module.js"></script>;
      console.log(import.meta); // { url: "file:///home/user/welcome-module.js" }
      ```

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

250. ### What is the comma operator

      The comma operator is used to evaluate each of its operands from left to right and returns the value of the last operand. This is totally different from comma usage within arrays, objects, and function arguments and parameters. For example, the usage for numeric expressions would be as below,

      ```javascript
      var x = 1;
      x = (x++, x);

      console.log(x); // 2
      ```

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

251. ### What is the advantage of the comma operator

      It is normally used to include multiple expressions in a location that requires a single expression. One of the common usages of this comma operator is to supply multiple parameters in a `for` loop. For example, the below for loop uses multiple expressions in a single location using comma operator,

      ```javascript
      for (var a = 0, b =10; a <= 10; a++, b--)
      ```

      You can also use the comma operator in a return statement where it processes before returning.

      ```javascript
      function myFunction() {
        var a = 1;
        return (a += 10), a; // 11
      }
      ```

252. ### What is typescript

      TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript created by Microsoft that adds optional types, classes
      and many other features, and compiles to plain JavaScript. Angular is built entirely in TypeScript and it is used as the primary language there. You can install it globally as

      ```bash
      npm install -g typescript
      ```

      Let's see a simple example of TypeScript usage,

      ```typescript
      function greeting(name: string): string {
        return "Hello, " + name;
      }

      let user = "Sudheer";

      console.log(greeting(user));
      ```

      The greeting method allows only string type as argument.

253. ### What are the differences between javascript and typescript

      Below are the list of differences between javascript and typescript,

      | feature             | typescript                            | javascript                                      |
      | ------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
      | Language paradigm   | Object oriented programming language  | Multi-paradigm language                         |
      | Typing support      | Supports static typing                | Dynamic typing                                  |
      | Modules             | Supported                             | Not supported                                   |
      | Interface           | It has interfaces concept             | Doesn't support interfaces                      |
      | Optional parameters | Functions support optional parameters | No support of optional parameters for functions |

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

254. ### What are the advantages of typescript over javascript

      Below are some of the advantages of typescript over javascript,

      1. TypeScript is able to find compile time errors at the development time only and it makes sures less runtime errors. Whereas javascript is an interpreted language.
      2. TypeScript is strongly-typed or supports static typing which allows for checking type correctness at compile time. This is not available in javascript.
      3. TypeScript compiler can compile the .ts files into ES3,ES4 and ES5 unlike ES6 features of javascript which may not be supported in some browsers.

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

255. ### What is an object initializer

      An object initializer is an expression that describes the initialization of an Object. The syntax for this expression is represented as a comma-delimited list of zero or more pairs of property names and associated values of an object, enclosed in curly braces ({}). This is also known as literal notation. It is one of the ways to create an object.

      ```javascript
      var initObject = { a: "John", b: 50, c: {} };

      console.log(initObject.a); // John
      ```

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

256. ### What is a constructor method

      The constructor method is a special method for creating and initializing an object created within a class. If you do not specify a constructor method, a default constructor is used. The example usage of constructor would be as below,

      ```javascript
      class Employee {
        constructor() {
          this.name = "John";
        }
      }

      var employeeObject = new Employee();

      console.log(employeeObject.name); // John
      ```

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

257. ### What happens if you write constructor more than once in a class

      The "constructor" in a class is a special method and it should be defined only once in a class. i.e, If you write a constructor method more than once in a class it will throw a `SyntaxError` error.

      ```javascript
       class Employee {
         constructor() {
           this.name = "John";
         }
         constructor() {   //  Uncaught SyntaxError: A class may only have one constructor
           this.age = 30;
         }
       }

       var employeeObject = new Employee();

       console.log(employeeObject.name);
      ```

      This constructor is called by using the special function call `new` (see example above).

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

258. ### How do you call the constructor of a parent class

      You can use the `super` keyword to call the constructor of a parent class. Remember that `super()` must be called before using `this` reference. Otherwise it will cause a reference error. Let's the usage of it,

      ```javascript
      class Square extends Rectangle {
        constructor(length) {
          super(length, length);
          this.name = "Square";
        }

        get area() {
          return this.width * this.height;
        }

        set area(value) {
          this.area = value;
        }
      }
      ```

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

259. ### How do you get the prototype of an object

      You can use the `Object.getPrototypeOf(obj)` method to return the prototype of the specified object. i.e. The value of the internal `prototype` property. If there are no inherited properties then `null` value is returned.

      ```javascript
      const newPrototype = {};
      const newObject = Object.create(newPrototype);

      console.log(Object.getPrototypeOf(newObject) === newPrototype); // true
      ```

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

260. ### What happens If I pass string type for getPrototype method

      In ES5, it will throw a TypeError exception if the obj parameter isn't an object. Whereas in ES2015, the parameter will be coerced to an `Object`.

      ```javascript
      // ES5
      Object.getPrototypeOf("James"); // TypeError: "James" is not an object
      // ES2015
      Object.getPrototypeOf("James"); // String.prototype
      ```

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

261. ### How do you set the prototype of one object to another

      You can use the `Object.setPrototypeOf()` method that sets the prototype (i.e., the internal `Prototype` property) of a specified object to another object or null. For example, if you want to set prototype of a square object to rectangle object would be as follows,

      ```javascript
      Object.setPrototypeOf(Square.prototype, Rectangle.prototype);
      Object.setPrototypeOf({}, null);
      ```

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

262. ### How do you check whether an object can be extended or not

      The `Object.isExtensible()` method is used to determine if an object is extendable or not. i.e, Whether it can have new properties added to it or not.

      ```javascript
      const newObject = {};
      console.log(Object.isExtensible(newObject)); //true
      ```

      **Note:** By default, all the objects are extendable. i.e, The new properties can be added or modified.

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

263. ### How do you prevent an object from being extend

      The `Object.preventExtensions()` method is used to prevent new properties from ever being added to an object. In other words, it prevents future extensions to the object. Let's see the usage of this property,

      ```javascript
      const newObject = {};
      Object.preventExtensions(newObject); // NOT extendable

      try {
        Object.defineProperty(newObject, "newProperty", {
          // Adding new property
          value: 100,
        });
      } catch (e) {
        console.log(e); // TypeError: Cannot define property newProperty, object is not extensible
      }
      ```

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

264. ### What are the different ways to make an object non-extensible

      You can mark an object non-extensible in 3 ways,

      1. `Object.preventExtensions`
      2. `Object.seal`
      3. `Object.freeze`

      ```javascript
      var newObject = {};

      Object.preventExtensions(newObject); // Prevent objects are non-extensible
      Object.isExtensible(newObject); // false

      var sealedObject = Object.seal({}); // Sealed objects are non-extensible
      Object.isExtensible(sealedObject); // false

      var frozenObject = Object.freeze({}); // Frozen objects are non-extensible
      Object.isExtensible(frozenObject); // false
      ```

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

265. ### How do you define multiple properties on an object

      The `Object.defineProperties()` method is used to define new or modify existing properties directly on an object and returning the object. Let's define multiple properties on an empty object,

      ```javascript
      const newObject = {};

      Object.defineProperties(newObject, {
        newProperty1: {
          value: "John",
          writable: true,
        },
        newProperty2: {},
      });
      ```

266. ### What is the MEAN stack

      The MEAN (MongoDB, Express, AngularJS, and Node.js) stack is the most popular open-source JavaScript software tech stack available for building dynamic web apps where you can write both the server-side and client-side halves of the web project entirely in JavaScript.

267. ### What is obfuscation in javascript

      Obfuscation is the deliberate act of creating obfuscated javascript code(i.e, source or machine code) that is difficult for humans to understand. It is something similar to encryption, but a machine can understand the code and execute it.
      Let's see the below function before Obfuscation,

      ```javascript
      function greeting() {
        console.log("Hello, welcome to JS world");
      }
      ```

      And after the code Obfuscation, it would be appeared as below,

      ```javascript
      eval(
        (function (p, a, c, k, e, d) {
          e = function (c) {
            return c;
          };
          if (!"".replace(/^/, String)) {
            while (c--) {
              d[c] = k[c] || c;
            }
            k = [
              function (e) {
                return d[e];
              },
            ];
            e = function () {
              return "\\w+";
            };
            c = 1;
          }
          while (c--) {
            if (k[c]) {
              p = p.replace(new RegExp("\\b" + e(c) + "\\b", "g"), k[c]);
            }
          }
          return p;
        })(
          "2 1(){0.3('4, 7 6 5 8')}",
          9,
          9,
          "console|greeting|function|log|Hello|JS|to|welcome|world".split("|"),
          0,
          {}
        )
      );
      ```

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

268. ### Why do you need Obfuscation

      Below are the few reasons for Obfuscation,

      1. The Code size will be reduced. So data transfers between server and client will be fast.
      2. It hides the business logic from outside world and protects the code from others
      3. Reverse engineering is highly difficult
      4. The download time will be reduced

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

269. ### What is Minification

      Minification is the process of removing all unnecessary characters(empty spaces are removed) and variables will be renamed without changing it's functionality. It is also a type of obfuscation .

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

270. ### What are the advantages of minification

      Normally it is recommended to use minification for heavy traffic and intensive requirements of resources. It reduces file sizes with below benefits,

      1. Decreases loading times of a web page
      2. Saves bandwidth usages

271. ### What are the differences between obfuscation and Encryption

      Below are the main differences between obfuscation and encryption,

      | Feature            | Obfuscation                                     | Encryption                                                              |

      There are many online/offline tools to minify the javascript files,

      1. Google's Closure Compiler
      2. UglifyJS2
      3. jsmin

273. ### How do you perform form validation using javascript

      JavaScript can be used to perform HTML form validation. For example, if the form field is empty, the function needs to notify, and return false, to prevent the form being submitted.
      Lets' perform user login in an html form,

      ```html
      <form name="myForm" onsubmit="return validateForm()" method="post">
        User name:
        <input type="text" name="uname" />
        <input type="submit" value="Submit" />
      </form>
      ```

      And the validation on user login is below,

      ```javascript
      function validateForm() {
        var x = document.forms["myForm"]["uname"].value;
        if (x == "") {
          alert("The username shouldn't be empty");
          return false;
        }
      }
      ```

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

274. ### How do you perform form validation without javascript

      You can perform HTML form validation automatically without using javascript. The validation enabled by applying the `required` attribute to prevent form submission when the input is empty.

      ```html
      <form method="post">
        <input type="text" name="uname" required />
        <input type="submit" value="Submit" />
      </form>
      ```

      **Note:** Automatic form validation does not work in Internet Explorer 9 or earlier.

275. ### What are the DOM methods available for constraint validation

      The below DOM methods are available for constraint validation on an invalid input,

      1. `checkValidity()`: It returns true if an input element contains valid data.
      2. `setCustomValidity()`: It is used to set the `validationMessage` property of an input element.
         Let's take an user login form with DOM validations

      ```javascript
      function myFunction() {
        var userName = document.getElementById("uname");
        if (!userName.checkValidity()) {
          document.getElementById("message").innerHTML =
            userName.validationMessage;
        } else {
          document.getElementById("message").innerHTML =
            "Entered a valid username";
        }
      }
      ```

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

276. ### What are the available constraint validation DOM properties

      Below are the list of some of the constraint validation DOM properties available,

      1. `validity`: It provides a list of boolean properties related to the validity of an input element.
      2. `validationMessage`: It displays the message when the validity is false.
      3. `willValidate`: It indicates if an input element will be validated or not.

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

277. ### What are the validity properties

      The validity property of an input element provides a set of properties related to the validity of data.

      1. `customError`: It returns true, if a custom validity message is set.
      2. `patternMismatch`: It returns true, if an element's value does not match its pattern attribute.
      3. `rangeOverflow`: It returns true, if an element's value is greater than its max attribute.
      4. `rangeUnderflow`: It returns true, if an element's value is less than its min attribute.
      5. `stepMismatch`: It returns true, if an element's value is invalid according to step attribute.
      6. `tooLong`: It returns true, if an element's value exceeds its maxLength attribute.
      7. `typeMismatch`: It returns true, if an element's value is invalid according to type attribute.
      8. `valueMissing`: It returns true, if an element with a required attribute has no value.
      9. `valid`: It returns true, if an element's value is valid.

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

278. ### Give an example usage of the rangeOverflow property

      If an element's value is greater than its max attribute then the `rangeOverflow` property is true. For example, the below form submission throws an error if the value is more than 100,

      ```html
      <input id="age" type="number" max="100" />
      <button onclick="myOverflowFunction()">OK</button>
      ```

      ```javascript
      function myOverflowFunction() {
        if (document.getElementById("age").validity.rangeOverflow) {
          alert("The mentioned age is not allowed");
        }
      }
      ```

279. ### Are enums available in javascript

      No, javascript does not natively support enums. But there are different kinds of solutions to simulate them even though they may not provide exact equivalents. For example, you can use freeze or seal on object,

      ```javascript
      var DaysEnum = Object.freeze({"monday":1, "tuesday":2, "wednesday":3, ...})
      ```

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

280. ### What is an enum

      An enum is a type restricting variables to one value from a predefined set of constants. JavaScript has no enums but typescript provides built-in enum support.

      ```javascript
      enum Color {
       RED, GREEN, BLUE
      }
      ```

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

281. ### How do you list all properties of an object

      You can use the `Object.getOwnPropertyNames()` method which returns an array of all properties found directly in a given object. Let's see the usage of this in an example below:

      ```javascript
      const newObject = {
        a: 1,
        b: 2,
        c: 3,
      };

      console.log(Object.getOwnPropertyNames(newObject));
      ["a", "b", "c"];
      ```

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

282. ### How do you get property descriptors of an object

      You can use the `Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptors()` method which returns all own property descriptors of a given object. The example usage of this method is below,

      ```javascript
      const newObject = {
        a: 1,
        b: 2,
        c: 3,
      };
      const descriptorsObject = Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptors(newObject);
      console.log(descriptorsObject.a.writable); //true
      console.log(descriptorsObject.a.configurable); //true
      console.log(descriptorsObject.a.enumerable); //true
      console.log(descriptorsObject.a.value); // 1
      ```

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

283. ### What are the attributes provided by a property descriptor

      A property descriptor is a record which has the following attributes

      1. `value`: The value associated with the property
      2. `writable`: Determines whether the value associated with the property can be changed or not
      3. `configurable`: Returns true if the type of this property descriptor can be changed and if the property can be deleted from the corresponding object.
      4. `enumerable`: Determines whether the property appears during enumeration of the properties on the corresponding object or not.
      5. `set`: A function which serves as a setter for the property
      6. `get`: A function which serves as a getter for the property

284. ### How do you extend classes

      The `extends` keyword is used in class declarations/expressions to create a class which is a child of another class. It can be used to subclass custom classes as well as built-in objects. The syntax would be as below,

      ```javascript
      class ChildClass extends ParentClass { ... }
      ```

      Let's take an example of Square subclass from Polygon parent class,

      ```javascript
      class Square extends Rectangle {
        constructor(length) {
          super(length, length);
          this.name = "Square";
        }

        get area() {
          return this.width * this.height;
        }

        set area(value) {
          this.area = value;
        }
      }
      ```

285. ### How do I modify the url without reloading the page

      The `window.location.href` property will be helpful to modify the url but it reloads the page. HTML5 introduced the `history.pushState()` and `history.replaceState()` methods, which allow you to add and modify history entries, respectively. For example, you can use pushState as below,

      ```javascript
      window.history.pushState("page2", "Title", "/page2.html");
      ```

      This mechanism is used by routing libraries of frameworks like React and Angular in order to simulate the behaviour of a multi-page-website, even though they are only SPA (Single Page Applications).

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

286. ### How do you check whether or not an array includes a particular value

      The `Array#includes()` method is used to determine whether an array includes a particular value among its entries by returning either true or false. Let's see an example to find an element(numeric and string) within an array.

      ```javascript
      var numericArray = [1, 2, 3, 4];
      console.log(numericArray.includes(3)); // true

      var stringArray = ["green", "yellow", "blue"];
      console.log(stringArray.includes("blue")); //true
      ```

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

287. ### How do you compare scalar arrays

      You can use length and every method of arrays to compare two scalars (compared directly using `===`) arrays. The combination of these expressions can give the expected result,

      ```javascript
      const arrayFirst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
      const arraySecond = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
      console.log(
        arrayFirst.length === arraySecond.length &&
          arrayFirst.every((value, index) => value === arraySecond[index])
      ); // true
      ```

      If you would like to compare arrays irrespective of order then you should sort them before,

      ```javascript
      const arrayFirst = [2, 3, 1, 4, 5];
      const arraySecond = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
      console.log(
        arrayFirst.length === arraySecond.length &&
          arrayFirst
            .sort()
            .every((value, index) => value === arraySecond[index])
      ); //true
      ```

288. ### How to get the value from get parameters

      The `new URL()` object accepts the url string and `searchParams` property of this object can be used to access the get parameters.

      ```javascript
      let urlString = "http://www.some-domain.com/about.html?x=1&y=2&z=3"; //window.location.href
      let url = new URL(urlString);
      let parameterZ = url.searchParams.get("z");
      console.log(parameterZ); // 3
      ```

289. ### How do you print numbers with commas as thousand separators

      You can use the `Number.prototype.toLocaleString()` method which returns a string with a language-sensitive representation such as thousand separator, currency etc. of this number.

      ```javascript
      function convertToThousandFormat(x) {
        return x.toLocaleString(); // 12,345.679
      }

      console.log(convertToThousandFormat(12345.6789));
      ```

290. ### What is the difference between java and javascript

      Both are totally unrelated programming languages and no relation between them. Java is statically typed, compiled, runs on its own VM. Whereas Javascript is dynamically typed, interpreted, and runs in a browser and nodejs environments. Let's see the major differences in a tabular format,
      | Feature | Java | JavaScript |
      |---- | ---- | -----
      | Typed | It's a strongly typed language | It's a dynamic typed language |
      | Paradigm | Object oriented programming | Prototype based programming |
      | Scoping | Block scoped | Function-scoped, block scoped since ES6 |
      | Concurrency | Thread based | event based |

291. ### Does JavaScript support namespaces

      JavaScript doesn’t support namespaces by default. So if you create any element (function, method, object, variable) then it becomes global and pollutes the global namespace. Let's take an example of defining two functions without any namespace,

      ```javascript
      function func1() {
        console.log("This is a first definition");
      }
      function func1() {
        console.log("This is a second definition");
      }
      func1(); // This is a second definition
      ```

      It always calls the second function definition. In this case, namespaces will solve the name collision problem.

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

292. ### How do you declare a namespace

      Even though JavaScript lacks namespaces, we can use Objects, an IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) or `let`/`const` to create namespaces.

      1. **Using Object Literal Notation:** Let's wrap variables and functions inside an Object literal which acts as a namespace. After that you can access them using object notation

         ```javascript
         var namespaceOne = {
             function func1() {
                 console.log("This is a first definition");
             }
         }
         var namespaceTwo = {
               function func1() {
                   console.log("This is a second definition");
               }
           }
         namespaceOne.func1(); // This is a first definition
         namespaceTwo.func1(); // This is a second definition
         ```

      2. **Using IIFE (Immediately invoked function expression):** The outer pair of parentheses of IIFE creates a local scope for all the code inside of it and makes the anonymous function a function expression. Due to that, you can create the same function in two different function expressions to act as a namespace.

         ```javascript
         (function () {
           function fun1() {
             console.log("This is a first definition");
           }
           fun1();
         })();

         (function () {
           function fun1() {
             console.log("This is a second definition");
           }
           fun1();
         })();
         ```

      3. **Using a block and a let/const declaration:** In ECMAScript 6, you can simply use a block and a let declaration to restrict the scope of a variable to a block.

         ```javascript
         {
           let myFunction = function fun1() {
             console.log("This is a first definition");
           };
           myFunction();
         }
         //myFunction(): ReferenceError: myFunction is not defined.

         {
           let myFunction = function fun1() {
             console.log("This is a second definition");
           };
           myFunction();
         }
         //myFunction(): ReferenceError: myFunction is not defined.
         ```

293. ### How do you invoke javascript code in an iframe from the parent page

      Initially iFrame needs to be accessed using either `document.getElementBy` or `window.frames`. After that `contentWindow` property of iFrame gives the access for targetFunction

      ```javascript
      document.getElementById("targetFrame").contentWindow.targetFunction();
      window.frames[0].frameElement.contentWindow.targetFunction(); // Accessing iframe this way may not work in latest versions chrome and firefox
      ```

294. ### How do you get the timezone offset of a date object

      You can use the `getTimezoneOffset` method of the date object. This method returns the time zone difference, in minutes, from current locale (host system settings) to UTC

      ```javascript
      var offset = new Date().getTimezoneOffset();
      console.log(offset); // -480
      ```

295. ### How do you load CSS and JS files dynamically

      You can create both link and script elements in the DOM and append them as child to head tag. Let's create a function to add script and style resources as below,

      ```javascript
      function loadAssets(filename, filetype) {
        if (filetype == "css") {
          // External CSS file
          var fileReference = document.createElement("link");
          fileReference.setAttribute("rel", "stylesheet");
          fileReference.setAttribute("type", "text/css");
          fileReference.setAttribute("href", filename);
        } else if (filetype == "js") {
          // External JavaScript file
          var fileReference = document.createElement("script");
          fileReference.setAttribute("type", "text/javascript");
          fileReference.setAttribute("src", filename);
        }
        if (typeof fileReference != "undefined")
          document.getElementsByTagName("head")[0].appendChild(fileReference);
      }
      ```

296. ### What are the different methods to find HTML elements in DOM

      If you want to access any element in an HTML page, you need to start with accessing the document object. Later you can use any of the below methods to find the HTML element,

      1. `document.getElementById(id)`: It finds an element by Id
      2. `document.getElementsByTagName(name)`: It finds an element by tag name (returns an node list)
      3. `document.getElementsByClassName(name)`: It finds an element by class name (returns an node list)
      4. `document.querySelector(cssSelector)`: It finds an element by css selector
      5. `document.querySelectorAll(cssSelector)`: It finds all elements by css selector (returns a node list)

297. ### What is jQuery

      jQuery is a popular cross-browser JavaScript library that provides Document Object Model (DOM) traversal, event handling, animations and AJAX interactions by minimizing the discrepancies across browsers. It is widely famous with its philosophy of “Write less, do more”. For example, you can display welcome message on the page load using jQuery as below,

      ```javascript
      $(document).ready(function () {
        // It selects the document and apply the function on page load
        alert("Welcome to jQuery world");
      });
      ```

      **Note:** You can download it from jquery's official site or install it from CDNs, like google.

298. ### What is V8 JavaScript engine

      V8 is an open source high-performance JavaScript engine used by the Google Chrome browser, written in C++. It is also being used in the node.js project. It implements ECMAScript and WebAssembly, and runs on Windows 7 or later, macOS 10.12+, and Linux systems that use x64, IA-32, ARM, or MIPS processors.
      **Note:** It can run standalone, or can be embedded into any C++ application.

299. ### Why do we call javascript as dynamic language

      JavaScript is a loosely typed or a dynamic language because variables in JavaScript are not directly associated with any particular value type, and any variable can be assigned/reassigned with values of all types.

      ```javascript
      let age = 50; // age is a number now
      age = "old"; // age is a string now
      age = true; // age is a boolean
      ```

300. ### What is a void operator

      The `void` operator evaluates the given expression and then returns `undefined` (i.e, without returning value). The syntax would be as below,

      ```javascript
      void expression;
      void expression;
      ```

      Let's display a message without any redirection or reload

      ```javascript
      <a href="javascript:void(alert('Welcome to JS world'))">
        Click here to see a message
      </a>
      ```

      **Note:** This operator is often used to obtain the undefined primitive value, using `void(0)`. Also it can be used to call asynchronous functions without waiting for the result.

301. ### How to set the cursor to wait

      The cursor can be set to wait in JavaScript by using the property `cursor`. Let's perform this behavior on page load using the below function.

      ```javascript
      function myFunction() {
        window.document.body.style.cursor = "wait";
      }
      ```

      and this function invoked on page load

      ```html
      <body onload="myFunction()"></body>
      ```

302. ### How do you create an infinite loop

      You can create infinite loops using for and while loops without using any expressions. The for loop construct or syntax is better approach in terms of ESLint and code optimizer tools,

      ```javascript
      for (;;) {}
      while (true) {}
      ```

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

303. ### Why do you need to avoid with statement

      JavaScript's with statement was intended to provide a shorthand for writing recurring accesses to objects. So it can help reduce file size by reducing the need to repeat a lengthy object reference without performance penalty. Let's take an example where it is used to avoid redundancy when accessing an object several times.

      ```javascript
      a.b.c.greeting = "welcome";
      a.b.c.age = 32;
      ```

      Using `with` it turns this into:

      ```javascript
      with (a.b.c) {
        greeting = "welcome";
        age = 32;
      }
      ```

      But this `with` statement creates performance problems since one cannot predict whether an argument will refer to a real variable or to a property inside the with argument.

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

304. ### What is the output of the following for loops

      ```javascript
      for (var i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
        // global scope
        setTimeout(() => console.log(i));
      }

      for (let i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
        // block scope
        setTimeout(() => console.log(i));
      }
      ```

      The output of the above for loops is 4 4 4 4 and 0 1 2 3

      **Explanation:** Due to the event queue/loop of javascript, the `setTimeout` callback function is called after the loop has been executed. Since the variable i is declared with the `var` keyword it became a global variable and the value was equal to 4 using iteration when the time `setTimeout` function is invoked. Hence, the output of the second loop is `4 4 4 4`.

      Whereas in the second loop, the variable i is declared as the `let` keyword it becomes a block scoped variable and it holds a new value(0, 1 ,2 3) for each iteration. Hence, the output of the first loop is `0 1 2 3`.

305. ### List down some of the features of ES6

      Below are the list of some new features of ES6,

      1. Support for constants or immutable variables
      2. Block-scope support for variables, constants and functions
      3. Arrow functions
      4. Default parameters
      5. Rest and Spread Parameters
      6. Template Literals
      7. Multi-line Strings
      8. Destructuring Assignment
      9. Enhanced Object Literals
      10. Promises
      11. Classes
      12. Modules

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

306. ### What is ES6

      ES6 is the sixth edition of the javascript language and it was released in June 2015. It was initially known as ECMAScript 6 (ES6) and later renamed to ECMAScript 2015. Almost all the modern browsers support ES6 but for the old browsers there are many transpilers, like Babel.js etc.

307. ### Can I redeclare let and const variables

      No, you cannot redeclare let and const variables. If you do, it throws below error

      ```bash
      Uncaught SyntaxError: Identifier 'someVariable' has already been declared
      ```

      **Explanation:** The variable declaration with `var` keyword refers to a function scope and the variable is treated as if it were declared at the top of the enclosing scope due to hoisting feature. So all the multiple declarations contributing to the same hoisted variable without any error. Let's take an example of re-declaring variables in the same scope for both var and let/const variables.

      ```javascript
      var name = "John";
      function myFunc() {
        var name = "Nick";
        var name = "Abraham"; // Re-assigned in the same function block
        alert(name); // Abraham
      }
      myFunc();
      alert(name); // John
      ```

      The block-scoped multi-declaration throws syntax error,

      ```javascript
      let name = "John";
      function myFunc() {
        let name = "Nick";
        let name = "Abraham"; // Uncaught SyntaxError: Identifier 'name' has already been declared
        alert(name);
      }

      myFunc();
      alert(name);
      ```

308. ### Does the `const` variable make the value immutable

      No, the `const` variable doesn't make the value immutable. But it disallows subsequent assignments(i.e, You can declare with assignment but can't assign another value later)

      ```javascript
      const userList = [];
      userList.push("John"); // Can mutate even though it can't re-assign
      console.log(userList); // ['John']
      ```

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

309. ### What are default parameters

      In ES5, we need to depend on logical OR operators to handle default values of function parameters. Whereas in ES6, Default function parameters feature allows parameters to be initialized with default values if no value or undefined is passed. Let's compare the behavior with an examples,

      ```javascript
      //ES5
      var calculateArea = function (height, width) {
        height = height || 50;
        width = width || 60;

        return width * height;
      };
      console.log(calculateArea()); //300
      ```

      The default parameters makes the initialization more simpler,

      ```javascript
      //ES6
      var calculateArea = function (height = 50, width = 60) {
        return width * height;
      };

      console.log(calculateArea()); //300
      ```

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

310. ### What are template literals

      Template literals or template strings are string literals allowing embedded expressions. These are enclosed by the back-tick (`) character instead of double or single quotes.
      In ES6, this feature enables using dynamic expressions as below,

      ```javascript
      var greeting = `Welcome to JS World, Mr. ${firstName} ${lastName}.`;
      ```

      In ES5, you need break string like below,

      ```javascript
      var greeting = 'Welcome to JS World, Mr. ' + firstName + ' ' + lastName.`
      ```

      **Note:** You can use multi-line strings and string interpolation features with template literals.

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

311. ### How do you write multi-line strings in template literals

      In ES5, you would have to use newline escape characters('\\n') and concatenation symbols(+) in order to get multi-line strings.

      ```javascript
      console.log("This is string sentence 1\n" + "This is string sentence 2");
      ```

      Whereas in ES6, You don't need to mention any newline sequence character,

      ```javascript
      console.log(`This is string sentence
      'This is string sentence 2`);
      ```

312. ### What are nesting templates

      The nesting template is a feature supported within template literals syntax to allow inner backticks inside a placeholder ${ } within the template. For example, the below nesting template is used to display the icons based on user permissions whereas outer template checks for platform type,

      ```javascript
      const iconStyles = `icon ${
        isMobilePlatform()
          ? ""
          : `icon-${user.isAuthorized ? "submit" : "disabled"}`
      }`;
      ```

      You can write the above use case without nesting template features as well. However, the nesting template feature is more compact and readable.

      ```javascript
      //Without nesting templates
      const iconStyles = `icon ${
        isMobilePlatform()
          ? ""
          : user.isAuthorized
          ? "icon-submit"
          : "icon-disabled"
      }`;
      ```

313. ### What are tagged templates

      Tagged templates are the advanced form of templates in which tags allow you to parse template literals with a function. The tag function accepts the first parameter as an array of strings and remaining parameters as expressions. This function can also return manipulated strings based on parameters. Let's see the usage of this tagged template behavior of an IT professional skill set in an organization,

      ```javascript
      var user1 = "John";
      var skill1 = "JavaScript";
      var experience1 = 15;

      var user2 = "Kane";
      var skill2 = "JavaScript";
      var experience2 = 5;

      function myInfoTag(strings, userExp, experienceExp, skillExp) {
        var str0 = strings[0]; // "Mr/Ms. "
        var str1 = strings[1]; // " is a/an "
        var str2 = strings[2]; // "in"

        var expertiseStr;
        if (experienceExp > 10) {
          expertiseStr = "expert developer";
        } else if (skillExp > 5 && skillExp <= 10) {
          expertiseStr = "senior developer";
        } else {
          expertiseStr = "junior developer";
        }

        return `${str0}${userExp}${str1}${expertiseStr}${str2}${skillExp}`;
      }

      var output1 = myInfoTag`Mr/Ms. ${user1} is a/an ${experience1} in ${skill1}`;
      var output2 = myInfoTag`Mr/Ms. ${user2} is a/an ${experience2} in ${skill2}`;

      console.log(output1); // Mr/Ms. John is a/an expert developer in JavaScript
      console.log(output2); // Mr/Ms. Kane is a/an junior developer in JavaScript
      ```

314. ### What are raw strings

      ES6 provides a raw strings feature using the `String.raw()` method which is used to get the raw string form of template strings. This feature allows you to access the raw strings as they were entered, without processing escape sequences. For example, the usage would be as below,

      ```javascript
      var calculationString = String.raw`The sum of numbers is \n${
        1 + 2 + 3 + 4
      }!`;
      console.log(calculationString); // The sum of numbers is \n10!
      ```

      If you don't use raw strings, the newline character sequence will be processed by displaying the output in multiple lines

      ```javascript
      var calculationString = `The sum of numbers is \n${1 + 2 + 3 + 4}!`;
      console.log(calculationString);
      // The sum of numbers is
      // 10!
      ```

      Also, the raw property is available on the first argument to the tag function

      ```javascript
      function tag(strings) {
        console.log(strings.raw[0]);
      }
      ```

315. ### What is destructuring assignment

      The destructuring assignment is a JavaScript expression that makes it possible to unpack values from arrays or properties from objects into distinct variables.
      Let's get the month values from an array using destructuring assignment

      ```javascript
      var [one, two, three] = ["JAN", "FEB", "MARCH"];

      console.log(one); // "JAN"
      console.log(two); // "FEB"
      console.log(three); // "MARCH"
      ```

      and you can get user properties of an object using destructuring assignment,

      ```javascript
      var { name, age } = { name: "John", age: 32 };

      console.log(name); // John
      console.log(age); // 32
      ```

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

316. ### What are default values in destructuring assignment

      A variable can be assigned a default value when the value unpacked from the array or object is undefined during destructuring assignment. It helps to avoid setting default values separately for each assignment. Let's take an example for both arrays and object use cases,

      **Arrays destructuring:**

      ```javascript
      var x, y, z;

      [x = 2, y = 4, z = 6] = [10];
      console.log(x); // 10
      console.log(y); // 4
      console.log(z); // 6
      ```

      **Objects destructuring:**

      ```javascript
      var { x = 2, y = 4, z = 6 } = { x: 10 };

      console.log(x); // 10
      console.log(y); // 4
      console.log(z); // 6
      ```

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

317. ### How do you swap variables in destructuring assignment

      If you don't use destructuring assignment, swapping two values requires a temporary variable. Whereas using a destructuring feature, two variable values can be swapped in one destructuring expression. Let's swap two number variables in array destructuring assignment,

      ```javascript
      var x = 10,
        y = 20;

      [x, y] = [y, x];
      console.log(x); // 20
      console.log(y); // 10
      ```

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

318. ### What are enhanced object literals

      Object literals make it easy to quickly create objects with properties inside the curly braces. For example, it provides shorter syntax for common object property definition as below.

      ```javascript
      //ES6
      var x = 10,
        y = 20;
      obj = { x, y };
      console.log(obj); // {x: 10, y:20}
      //ES5
      var x = 10,
        y = 20;
      obj = { x: x, y: y };
      console.log(obj); // {x: 10, y:20}
      ```

319. ### What are dynamic imports

      The dynamic imports using `import()` function syntax allows us to load modules on demand by using promises or the async/await syntax. Currently this feature is in [stage4 proposal](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-dynamic-import). The main advantage of dynamic imports is reduction of our bundle's sizes, the size/payload response of our requests and overall improvements in the user experience.
      The syntax of dynamic imports would be as below,

      ```javascript
      import("./Module").then((Module) => Module.method());
      ```

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

320. ### What are the use cases for dynamic imports

      Below are some of the use cases of using dynamic imports over static imports,

      1. Import a module on-demand or conditionally. For example, if you want to load a polyfill on legacy browser

         ```javascript
         if (isLegacyBrowser()) {
             import(···)
             .then(···);
         }
         ```

      2. Compute the module specifier at runtime. For example, you can use it for internationalization.

         ```javascript
         import(`messages_${getLocale()}.js`).then(···);
         ```

      3. Import a module from within a regular script instead a module.

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

321. ### What are typed arrays

      Typed arrays are array-like objects from ECMAScript 6 API for handling binary data. JavaScript provides 12 Typed array types,

      1. Int8Array: An array of 8-bit signed integers
      2. Uint8Array: An array of 8-bit unsigned integers
      3. Uint8ClampedArray: An array of 8-bit unsigned integers clamped to 0-255
      4. Int16Array: An array of 16-bit signed integers
      5. Uint16Array: An array of 16-bit unsigned integers
      6. Int32Array: An array of 32-bit signed integers
      7. Uint32Array: An array of 32-bit unsigned integers
      8. BigInt64Array: An array of 64-bit signed BigInts
      9. BigUint64Array: An array of 64-bit unsigned BigInts
      10. Float16Array: An array of 16-bit floating point numbers
      11. Float32Array: An array of 32-bit floating point numbers
      12. Float64Array: An array of 64-bit floating point numbers

      For example, you can create an array of 8-bit signed integers as below

      ```javascript
      const a = new Int8Array();
      // You can pre-allocate n bytes
      const bytes = 1024;
      const a = new Int8Array(bytes);
      ```

322. ### What are the advantages of module loaders

      The module loaders provides the below features,

      1. Dynamic loading
      2. State isolation
      3. Global namespace isolation
      4. Compilation hooks
      5. Nested virtualization

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

323. ### What is collation

      Collation is used for sorting a set of strings and searching within a set of strings. It is parameterized by locale and aware of Unicode. Let's take comparison and sorting features,

      1. **Comparison:**

      ```javascript
      var list = ["ä", "a", "z"]; // In German,  "ä" sorts with "a" Whereas in Swedish, "ä" sorts after "z"
      var l10nDE = new Intl.Collator("de");
      var l10nSV = new Intl.Collator("sv");
      console.log(l10nDE.compare("ä", "z") === -1); // true
      console.log(l10nSV.compare("ä", "z") === +1); // true
      ```

      2. **Sorting:**

      ```javascript
      var list = ["ä", "a", "z"]; // In German,  "ä" sorts with "a" Whereas in Swedish, "ä" sorts after "z"
      var l10nDE = new Intl.Collator("de");
      var l10nSV = new Intl.Collator("sv");
      console.log(list.sort(l10nDE.compare)); // [ "a", "ä", "z" ]
      console.log(list.sort(l10nSV.compare)); // [ "a", "z", "ä" ]
      ```

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

324. ### What is for...of statement

      The for...of statement creates a loop iterating over iterable objects or elements such as built-in String, Array, Array-like objects (like arguments or NodeList), TypedArray, Map, Set, and user-defined iterables. The basic usage of for...of statement on arrays would be as below,

      ```javascript
      let arrayIterable = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];

      for (let value of arrayIterable) {
        value++;
        console.log(value); // 11 21 31 41 51
      }
      ```

325. ### What is the output of below spread operator array

      ```javascript
      [..."John Resig"];
      ```

      The output of the array is ['J', 'o', 'h', 'n', ' ', 'R', 'e', 's', 'i', 'g']

      **Explanation:** The string is an iterable type and the spread operator within an array maps every character of an iterable to one element. Hence, each character of a string becomes an element within an Array.

326. ### Is PostMessage secure

      Yes, postMessages can be considered very secure as long as the programmer/developer is careful about checking the origin and source of an arriving message. But if you try to send/receive a message without verifying its source will create cross-site scripting attacks.

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

327. ### What are the problems with postmessage target origin as wildcard

      The second argument of postMessage method specifies which origin is allowed to receive the message. If you use the wildcard “\*” as an argument then any origin is allowed to receive the message. In this case, there is no way for the sender window to know if the target window is at the target origin when sending the message. If the target window has been navigated to another origin, the other origin would receive the data. Hence, this may lead to XSS vulnerabilities.

      ```javascript
      targetWindow.postMessage(message, "*");
      ```

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

328. ### How do you avoid receiving postMessages from attackers

      Since the listener listens for any message, an attacker can trick the application by sending a message from the attacker’s origin, which gives an impression that the receiver received the message from the actual sender’s window. You can avoid this issue by validating the origin of the message on the receiver's end using the “message.origin” attribute.

      For example, let's check the sender's origin [http://www.some-sender.com](http://www.some-sender.com) on receiver side [www.some-receiver.com](www.some-receiver.com),

      ```javascript
      //Listener on http://www.some-receiver.com/
      window.addEventListener("message", function(message){
          if(/^http://www\.some-sender\.com$/.test(message.origin)){
               console.log('You received the data from valid sender', message.data);
         }
      });
      ```

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

329. ### Can I avoid using postMessages completely

      You cannot avoid using postMessages completely(or 100%). Even though your application doesn’t use postMessage considering the risks, a lot of third party scripts use postMessage to communicate with the third party service. So your application might be using postMessage without your knowledge.

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

330. ### Is postMessages synchronous

      The postMessages are synchronous in IE8 browser but they are asynchronous in IE9 and all other modern browsers (i.e, IE9+, Firefox, Chrome, Safari).Due to this asynchronous behaviour, we use a callback mechanism when the postMessage is returned.

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

331. ### What paradigm is Javascript

      JavaScript is a multi-paradigm language, supporting imperative/procedural programming, Object-Oriented Programming and functional programming. JavaScript supports Object-Oriented Programming with prototypical inheritance.

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

332. ### What is the difference between internal and external javascript

      **Internal JavaScript:** It is the source code within the script tag.
      **External JavaScript:** The source code is stored in an external file(stored with .js extension) and referred with in the tag.

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

333. ### Is JavaScript faster than server side script

      Yes, JavaScript is faster than server side scripts. Because JavaScript is a client-side script it does not require any web server’s help for its computation or calculation. So JavaScript is always faster than any server-side script like ASP, PHP, etc.

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

334. ### How do you get the status of a checkbox

      You can apply the `checked` property on the selected checkbox in the DOM. If the value is `true` it means the checkbox is checked, otherwise it is unchecked. For example, the below HTML checkbox element can be access using javascript as below:

      ```html
      <input type="checkbox" id="checkboxname" value="Agree" />
      Agree the conditions
      <br />
      ```

      ```javascript
      console.log(document.getElementById(‘checkboxname’).checked); // true or false
      ```

335. ### What is the purpose of double tilde operator

      The double tilde operator(~~) is known as double NOT bitwise operator. This operator is a slightly quicker substitute for Math.floor().

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

336. ### How do you convert character to ASCII code

      You can use the `String.prototype.charCodeAt()` method to convert string characters to ASCII numbers. For example, let's find ASCII code for the first letter of 'ABC' string,

      ```javascript
      "ABC".charCodeAt(0); // returns 65
      ```

      Whereas `String.fromCharCode()` method converts numbers to equal ASCII characters.

      ```javascript
      String.fromCharCode(65, 66, 67); // returns 'ABC'
      ```

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

337. ### What is ArrayBuffer

      An ArrayBuffer object is used to represent a generic, fixed-length raw binary data buffer. You can create it as below,

      ```javascript
      let buffer = new ArrayBuffer(16); // create a buffer of length 16
      alert(buffer.byteLength); // 16
      ```

      To manipulate an ArrayBuffer, we need to use a “view” object.

      ```javascript
      //Create a DataView referring to the buffer
      let view = new DataView(buffer);
      ```

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

338. ### What is the output of below string expression

      ```javascript
      console.log("Welcome to JS world"[0]);
      ```

      The output of the above expression is "W".
      **Explanation:** The bracket notation with specific index on a string returns the character at a specific location. Hence, it returns the character "W" of the string. Since this is not supported in IE7 and below versions, you may need to use the .charAt() method to get the desired result.

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

339. ### What is the purpose of Error object

      The Error constructor creates an error object and the instances of error objects are thrown when runtime errors occur. The Error object can also be used as a base object for user-defined exceptions. The syntax of error object would be as below,

      ```javascript
      new Error([message[, fileName[, lineNumber]]])
      ```

      You can throw user defined exceptions or errors using Error object in try...catch block as below,

      ```javascript
      try {
        if (withdraw > balance)
          throw new Error("Oops! You don't have enough balance");
      } catch (e) {
        console.log(e.name + ": " + e.message);
      }
      ```

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

340. ### What is the purpose of EvalError object

      The EvalError object indicates an error regarding the global `eval()` function. Even though this exception is not thrown by JavaScript anymore, the EvalError object remains for compatibility. The syntax of this expression would be as below,

      ```javascript
      new EvalError([message[, fileName[, lineNumber]]])
      ```

      You can throw EvalError with in try...catch block as below,

      ```javascript
      try {
        throw new EvalError('Eval function error', 'someFile.js', 100);
      } catch (e) {
        console.log(e.message, e.name, e.fileName);              // "Eval function error", "EvalError", "someFile.js"
      ```

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

341. ### What are the list of cases error thrown from non-strict mode to strict mode

      When you apply 'use strict'; syntax, some of the below cases will throw a SyntaxError before executing the script

      1. When you use Octal syntax

      ```javascript
      var n = 022;
      ```

      2. Using `with` statement
      3. When you use delete operator on a variable name
      4. Using eval or arguments as variable or function argument name
      5. When you use newly reserved keywords
      6. When you declare a function in a block and access it from outside of the block

      ```javascript
      if (someCondition) {
        function f() {}
      }
      f(); // ReferenceError: f is not defined
      ```

      Hence, the errors from above cases are helpful to avoid errors in development/production environments.

342. ### Do all objects have prototypes

      No. All objects have prototypes except two exceptions:
      *  **Object.prototype** itself — This is the base object in the prototype chain, and **its prototype is** `null`.
      *   **Objects created with** `**Object.create(null)**` — These are deliberately created with **no prototype**, so they don’t inherit from `Object.prototype`.

      All other standard objects do have a prototype.  

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

343. ### What is the difference between a parameter and an argument

      Parameter is the variable name of a function definition whereas an argument represents the value given to a function when it is invoked. Let's explain this with a simple function

      ```javascript
      function myFunction(parameter1, parameter2, parameter3) {
        console.log(arguments[0]); // "argument1"
        console.log(arguments[1]); // "argument2"
        console.log(arguments[2]); // "argument3"
      }
      myFunction("argument1", "argument2", "argument3");
      ```

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

344. ### What is the purpose of some method in arrays

      The some() method is used to test whether at least one element in the array passes the test implemented by the provided function. The method returns a boolean value. Let's take an example to test for any odd elements,

      ```javascript
      var array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];

      var odd = (element) => element % 2 !== 0;

      console.log(array.some(odd)); // true (the odd element exists)
      ```

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

345. ### How do you combine two or more arrays

      The concat() method is used to join two or more arrays by returning a new array containing all the elements. The syntax would be as below,

      ```javascript
      array1.concat(array2, array3, ..., arrayX)
      ```

      Let's take an example of array's concatenation with veggies and fruits arrays,

      ```javascript
      var veggies = ["Tomato", "Carrot", "Cabbage"];
      var fruits = ["Apple", "Orange", "Pears"];
      var veggiesAndFruits = veggies.concat(fruits);
      console.log(veggiesAndFruits); // Tomato, Carrot, Cabbage, Apple, Orange, Pears
      ```

346. ### What is the difference between Shallow and Deep copy

      There are two ways to copy an object,

      **Shallow Copy:**
      Shallow copy is a bitwise copy of an object. A new object is created that has an exact copy of the values in the original object. If any of the fields of the object are references to other objects, just the reference addresses are copied i.e., only the memory address is copied.

      **Example**

      ```javascript
      var empDetails = {
        name: "John",
        age: 25,
        expertise: "Software Developer",
      };
      ```

      to create a duplicate

      ```javascript
      var empDetailsShallowCopy = empDetails; //Shallow copying!
      ```

      if we change some property value in the duplicate one like this:

      ```javascript
      empDetailsShallowCopy.name = "Johnson";
      ```

      The above statement will also change the name of `empDetails`, since we have a shallow copy. That means we're losing the original data as well.

      **Deep copy:**
      A deep copy copies all fields, and makes copies of dynamically allocated memory pointed to by the fields. A deep copy occurs when an object is copied along with the objects to which it refers.

      **Example**

      ```javascript
      var empDetails = {
        name: "John",
        age: 25,
        expertise: "Software Developer",
      };
      ```

      Create a deep copy by using the properties from the original object into new variable

      ```javascript
      var empDetailsDeepCopy = {
        name: empDetails.name,
        age: empDetails.age,
        expertise: empDetails.expertise,
      };
      ```

      Now if you change `empDetailsDeepCopy.name`, it will only affect `empDetailsDeepCopy` & not `empDetails`

347. ### How do you create specific number of copies of a string

      The `repeat()` method is used to construct and return a new string which contains the specified number of copies of the string on which it was called, concatenated together. Remember that this method has been added to the ECMAScript 2015 specification.
      Let's take an example of Hello string to repeat it 4 times,

      ```javascript
      "Hello".repeat(4); // 'HelloHelloHelloHello'
      ```

348. ### How do you return all matching strings against a regular expression

      The `matchAll()` method can be used to return an iterator of all results matching a string against a regular expression. For example, the below example returns an array of matching string results against a regular expression,

      ```javascript
      let regexp = /Hello(\d?)/g;
      let greeting = "Hello1Hello2Hello3";

      let greetingList = [...greeting.matchAll(regexp)];

      console.log(greetingList[0][0]); //Hello1
      console.log(greetingList[1][0]); //Hello2
      console.log(greetingList[2][0]); //Hello3
      ```

349. ### How do you trim a string at the beginning or ending

      The `trim` method of string prototype is used to trim on both sides of a string. But if you want to trim especially at the beginning or ending of the string then you can use `trimStart/trimLeft` and `trimEnd/trimRight` methods. Let's see an example of these methods on a greeting message,

      ```javascript
      var greeting = "   Hello, Goodmorning!   ";

      console.log(greeting); // "   Hello, Goodmorning!   "
      console.log(greeting.trimStart()); // "Hello, Goodmorning!   "
      console.log(greeting.trimLeft()); // "Hello, Goodmorning!   "

      console.log(greeting.trimEnd()); // "   Hello, Goodmorning!"
      console.log(greeting.trimRight()); // "   Hello, Goodmorning!"
      ```

350. ### What is the output of below console statement with unary operator

      Let's take console statement with unary operator as given below,

      ```javascript
      console.log(+"Hello"); // NaN
      ```

      The output of the above console log statement returns NaN. Because the element is prefixed by the unary operator and the JavaScript interpreter will try to convert that element into a number type. Since the conversion fails, the value of the statement results in NaN value.

351. ### Does javascript uses mixins

      JavaScript does not have built-in support for mixins as a formal language feature. However, developers commonly implement mixins using various patterns to enable code reuse and composition.

      A mixin is a way to add reusable functionality from one or more objects into a class or another object, without using classical inheritance. It promotes object composition by combining behaviors or properties from different sources into a single destination.

352. ### Mixin Example using Object composition
      ```javascript
      // Define a mixin
      const canEat = {
        eat() {
          console.log("Eating...");
        }
      };

      const canWalk = {
        walk() {
          console.log("Walking...");
        }
      };

      const canRead = {
        read() {
          console.log("Reading...");
        }
      };

      // Create a class
      class Person {
        constructor(name) {
          this.name = name;
        }
      }

      // Apply mixins
      Object.assign(Person.prototype, canEat, canWalk, canRead);

      // Use it
      const person = new Person("Sudheer");
      person.eat();  // Output: Eating...
      person.walk(); // Output: Walking...
      person.read(); // Output: Reading...
      ```
353. ### Benefits
      - Avoids deep inheritance hierarchies
      - Encourages composition over inheritance
      - Promotes reusable and modular code
  
      Modern JavaScript favors mixin alternatives like composition, delegation, higher-order functions, and class mixins to promote reusable and modular code. Libraries like Lodash offer utilities for object composition, while frameworks like Vue.js provide built-in mixin features to promote reusable and modular code.

354. ### What is a thunk function

      A thunk is just a function which delays the evaluation of the value. It doesn’t take any arguments but gives the value whenever you invoke the thunk. i.e, It is used not to execute now but it will be sometime in the future. Let's take a synchronous example,

      ```javascript
      const add = (x, y) => x + y;

      const thunk = () => add(2, 3);

      thunk(); // 5
      ```

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

355. ### What are asynchronous thunks

      The asynchronous thunks are useful to make network requests. Let's see an example of network requests,

      ```javascript
      function fetchData(fn) {
        fetch("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1")
          .then((response) => response.json())
          .then((json) => fn(json));
      }

      const asyncThunk = function () {
        return fetchData(function getData(data) {
          console.log(data);
        });
      };

      asyncThunk();
      ```

      The `getData` function won't be called immediately but it will be invoked only when the data is available from API endpoint. The setTimeout function is also used to make our code asynchronous. The best real time example is redux state management library which uses the asynchronous thunks to delay the actions to dispatch.

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

356. ### What is the output of below function calls

      **Code snippet:**

      ```javascript
      const circle = {
        radius: 20,
        diameter() {
          return this.radius * 2;
        },
        perimeter: () => 2 * Math.PI * this?.radius,
      };
      ```

      ```javascript
      console.log(circle.diameter());
      console.log(circle.perimeter());
      ```

      **Output:**

      The output is 40 and NaN. Remember that diameter is a regular function, whereas the value of perimeter is an arrow function. The `this` keyword of a regular function(i.e, diameter) refers to the surrounding scope which is a class(i.e, Shape object). Whereas this keyword of perimeter function refers to the surrounding scope which is a window object. Since there is no radius property on window objects it returns an undefined value and the multiple of number value returns NaN value.

357. ### How to remove all line breaks from a string

      The easiest approach is using regular expressions to detect and replace newlines in the string. In this case, we use replace function along with string to replace with, which in our case is an empty string.

      ```javascript
      function remove_linebreaks( var message ) {
          return message.replace( /[\r\n]+/gm, "" );
      }
      ```

      In the above expression, g and m are for global and multiline flags.

358. ### What is the difference between reflow and repaint

      A _repaint_ occurs when changes are made which affect the visibility of an element, but not its layout. Examples of this include outline, visibility, or background color. A _reflow_ involves changes that affect the layout of a portion of the page (or the whole page). Resizing the browser window, changing the font, content changing (such as user typing text), using JavaScript methods involving computed styles, adding or removing elements from the DOM, and changing an element's classes are a few of the things that can trigger reflow. Reflow of an element causes the subsequent reflow of all child and ancestor elements as well as any elements following it in the DOM.

359. ### What happens with negating an array

      Negating an array with `!` character will coerce the array into a boolean. Since Arrays are considered to be truthy So negating it will return `false`.

      ```javascript
      console.log(![]); // false
      ```

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

360. ### What happens if we add two arrays

      If you add two arrays together, it will convert them both to strings and concatenate them. For example, the result of adding arrays would be as below,

      ```javascript
      console.log(["a"] + ["b"]); // "ab"
      console.log([] + []); // ""
      console.log(![] + []); // "false", because ![] returns false.
      ```

361. ### What is the output of prepend additive operator on falsy values

      If you prepend the additive(+) operator on falsy values(null, undefined, NaN, false, ""), the falsy value converts to a number value zero. Let's display them on browser console as below,

      ```javascript
      console.log(+null); // 0
      console.log(+undefined); // NaN
      console.log(+false); // 0
      console.log(+NaN); // NaN
      console.log(+""); // 0
      ```

362. ### How do you create self string using special characters

      The self string can be formed with the combination of `[]()!+` characters. You need to remember the below conventions to achieve this pattern.

      1. Since Arrays are truthful values, negating the arrays will produce false: ![] === false
      2. As per JavaScript coercion rules, the addition of arrays together will toString them: [] + [] === ""
      3. Prepend an array with + operator will convert an array to false, the negation will make it true and finally converting the result will produce value '1': +(!(+[])) === 1

      By applying the above rules, we can derive below conditions

      ```javascript
      (![] + [] === "false" + !+[]) === 1;
      ```

      Now the character pattern would be created as below,

      ```javascript
            s               e               l               f
       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^

       (![] + [])[3] + (![] + [])[4] + (![] + [])[2] + (![] + [])[0]
       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^
      (![] + [])[+!+[]+!+[]+!+[]] +
      (![] + [])[+!+[]+!+[]+!+[]+!+[]] +
      (![] + [])[+!+[]+!+[]] +
      (![] + [])[+[]]
      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
      (![]+[])[+!+[]+!+[]+!+[]]+(![]+[])[+!+[]+!+[]+!+[]+!+[]]+(![]+[])[+!+[]+!+[]]+(![]+[])[+[]]
      ```

363. ### How do you remove falsy values from an array

      You can apply the filter method on the array by passing Boolean as a parameter. This way it removes all falsy values(0, undefined, null, false and "") from the array.

      ```javascript
      const myArray = [false, null, 1, 5, undefined];
      myArray.filter(Boolean); // [1, 5] // is same as myArray.filter(x => x);
      ```

364. ### How do you get unique values of an array

      You can get unique values of an array with the combination of `Set` and rest expression/spread(...) syntax.

      ```javascript
      console.log([...new Set([1, 2, 4, 4, 3])]); // [1, 2, 4, 3]
      ```

365. ### What is destructuring aliases

      Sometimes you would like to have a destructured variable with a different name than the property name. In that case, you'll use a `: newName` to specify a name for the variable. This process is called destructuring aliases.

      ```javascript
      const obj = { x: 1 };
      // Grabs obj.x as as { otherName }
      const { x: otherName } = obj;
      ```

366. ### How do you map the array values without using map method

      You can map the array values without using the `map` method by just using the `from` method of Array. Let's map city names from Countries array,

      ```javascript
      const countries = [
        { name: "India", capital: "Delhi" },
        { name: "US", capital: "Washington" },
        { name: "Russia", capital: "Moscow" },
        { name: "Singapore", capital: "Singapore" },
        { name: "China", capital: "Beijing" },
        { name: "France", capital: "Paris" },
      ];

      const cityNames = Array.from(countries, ({ capital }) => capital);
      console.log(cityNames); // ['Delhi, 'Washington', 'Moscow', 'Singapore', 'Beijing', 'Paris']
      ```

367. ### How do you empty an array

      You can empty an array quickly by setting the array length to zero.

      ```javascript
      let cities = ["Singapore", "Delhi", "London"];
      cities.length = 0; // cities becomes []
      ```

369. ### What is the easiest way to convert an array to an object

      You can convert an array to an object with the same data using spread(...) operator.

      ```javascript
      var fruits = ["banana", "apple", "orange", "watermelon"];
      var fruitsObject = { ...fruits };
      console.log(fruitsObject); // {0: "banana", 1: "apple", 2: "orange", 3: "watermelon"}
      ```

371. ### What are the placeholders from console object

      Below are the list of placeholders available from console object,

      1. %o — It takes an object,
      2. %s — It takes a string,
      3. %d — It is used for a decimal or integer
         These placeholders can be represented in the console.log as below

      ```javascript
      const user = { name: "John", id: 1, city: "Delhi" };
      console.log(
        "Hello %s, your details %o are available in the object form",
        "John",
        user
      ); // Hello John, your details {name: "John", id: 1, city: "Delhi"} are available in object
      ```

372. ### Is it possible to add CSS to console messages

      Yes, you can apply CSS styles to console messages similar to html text on the web page.

      ```javascript
      console.log(
        "%c The text has blue color, with large font and red background",
        "color: blue; font-size: x-large; background: red"
      );
      ```

      The text will be displayed as below,

375. ### How do you display data in a tabular format using console object

      The `console.table()` is used to display data in the console in a tabular format to visualize complex arrays or objects.

      ```js
      const users = [
        { name: "John", id: 1, city: "Delhi" },
        { name: "Max", id: 2, city: "London" },
        { name: "Rod", id: 3, city: "Paris" },
      ];
      console.table(users);
      ```

      The data visualized in a table format,

377. ### How do you create copy to clipboard button

      You need to select the content(using .select() method) of the input element and execute the copy command with execCommand (i.e, execCommand('copy')). You can also execute other system commands like cut and paste.

      ```javascript
      document.querySelector("#copy-button").onclick = function () {
        // Select the content
        document.querySelector("#copy-input").select();
        // Copy to the clipboard

379. ### How do you flattening multi dimensional arrays

      Flattening bi-dimensional arrays is trivial with Spread operator.

      ```javascript
      const biDimensionalArr = [11, [22, 33], [44, 55], [66, 77], 88, 99];
      const flattenArr = [].concat(...biDimensionalArr); // [11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66, 77, 88, 99]
      ```

      But you can make it work with multi-dimensional arrays by recursive calls,

      ```javascript
      function flattenMultiArray(arr) {
        const flattened = [].concat(...arr);
        return flattened.some((item) => Array.isArray(item))
          ? flattenMultiArray(flattened)
          : flattened;
      }
      const multiDimensionalArr = [
        11,
        [22, 33],
        [44, [55, 66, [77, [88]], 99]],
      ];
      const flatArr = flattenMultiArray(multiDimensionalArr); // [11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66, 77, 88, 99]
      ```

      Also you can use the `flat` method of Array.

      ```javascript
      const arr = [1, [2, 3], 4, 5, [6, 7]];
      const fllattenArr = arr.flat(); // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]

      // And for multiDimensional arrays
      const multiDimensionalArr = [
        11,
        [22, 33],
        [44, [55, 66, [77, [88]], 99]],
      ];
      const oneStepFlat = multiDimensionalArr.flat(1); // [11, 22, 33, 44, [55, 66, [77, [88]], 99]]
      const towStep = multiDimensionalArr.flat(2); // [11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66, [77, [88]], 99]
      const fullyFlatArray = multiDimensionalArr.flat(Infinity); // [11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66, 77, 88, 99]
      ```

380. ### What is the easiest multi condition checking

      You can use `indexOf` to compare input with multiple values instead of checking each value as one condition.

      ```javascript
      // Verbose approach
      if (
        input === "first" ||
        input === 1 ||
        input === "second" ||
        input === 2
      ) {
        someFunction();
      }
      // Shortcut
      if (["first", 1, "second", 2].indexOf(input) !== -1) {
        someFunction();
      }
      ```

381. ### How do you capture browser back button

      The `beforeunload` event is triggered when the window, the document and its resources are about to be unloaded. This event is helpful to warn users about losing the current data and detect back button event.

      ```javascript
      window.addEventListener("beforeunload", () => {
        console.log("Clicked browser back button");
      });
      ```

      You can also use `popstate` event to detect the browser back button.
      **Note:** The history entry has been activated using `history.pushState` method.

      ```javascript
      window.addEventListener("popstate", () => {
        console.log("Clicked browser back button");
        box.style.backgroundColor = "white";
      });

      const box = document.getElementById("div");

      box.addEventListener("click", () => {
        box.style.backgroundColor = "blue";
        window.history.pushState({}, null, null);
      });
      ```


    In the preceeding code, When the box element clicked, its background color appears in blue color and changed to while color upon clicking the browser back button using `popstate` event handler. The `state` property of `popstate` contains the copy of history entry's state object.

382. ### How do you disable right click in the web page

     The right click on the page can be disabled by returning false from the `oncontextmenu` attribute on the body element.

     ```html
     <body oncontextmenu="return false;"></body>
     ```

383. ### What are wrapper objects

     Primitive Values like string,number and boolean don't have properties and methods but they are temporarily converted or coerced to an object(Wrapper object) when you try to perform actions on them. For example, if you apply toUpperCase() method on a primitive string value, it does not throw an error but returns uppercase of the string.

     ```javascript
     let name = "john";

     console.log(name.toUpperCase()); // Behind the scenes treated as console.log(new String(name).toUpperCase());
     ```

     i.e, Every primitive except null and undefined have Wrapper Objects and the list of wrapper objects are String,Number,Boolean,Symbol and BigInt.

384. ### What is AJAX

     AJAX stands for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML and it is a group of related technologies(HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XMLHttpRequest API etc) used to display data asynchronously. i.e. We can send data to the server and get data from the server without reloading the web page.

385. ### What are the different ways to deal with Asynchronous Code

     Below are the list of different ways to deal with Asynchronous code.

     1. Callbacks
     2. Promises
     3. Async/await
     4. Third-party libraries such as async.js,bluebird etc

386. ### How to cancel a fetch request

     Until a few days back, One shortcoming of native promises is no direct way to cancel a fetch request. But the new `AbortController` from js specification allows you to use a signal to abort one or multiple fetch calls.
     The basic flow of cancelling a fetch request would be as below,

     1. Create an `AbortController` instance
     2. Get the signal property of an instance and pass the signal as a fetch option for signal
     3. Call the AbortController's abort property to cancel all fetches that use that signal
        For example, passing the same signal to multiple fetch calls will cancel all requests with that signal,

     ```javascript
     const controller = new AbortController();
     const { signal } = controller;

     fetch("http://localhost:8000", { signal })
       .then((response) => {
         console.log(`Request 1 is complete!`);
       })
       .catch((e) => {
         if (e.name === "AbortError") {
           // We know it's been canceled!
         }
       });

     fetch("http://localhost:8000", { signal })
       .then((response) => {
         console.log(`Request 2 is complete!`);
       })
       .catch((e) => {
         if (e.name === "AbortError") {
           // We know it's been canceled!
         }
       });

     // Wait 2 seconds to abort both requests
     setTimeout(() => controller.abort(), 2000);
     ```

387. ### What is web speech API

     Web speech API is used to enable modern browsers recognize and synthesize speech(i.e, voice data into web apps). This API was introduced by W3C Community in the year 2012. It has two main parts:

     1. **SpeechRecognition (Asynchronous Speech Recognition or Speech-to-Text):** It provides the ability to recognize voice context from an audio input and respond accordingly. This is accessed by the `SpeechRecognition` interface.
        The example below shows how to use this API to get text from speech,

     ```javascript
     window.SpeechRecognition =
       window.webkitSpeechRecognition || window.SpeechRecognition; // webkitSpeechRecognition for Chrome and SpeechRecognition for FF
     const recognition = new window.SpeechRecognition();
     recognition.onresult = (event) => {
       // SpeechRecognitionEvent type
       const speechToText = event.results[0][0].transcript;
       console.log(speechToText);
     };
     recognition.start();
     ```

     In this API, browser is going to ask you for permission to use your microphone

     2. **SpeechSynthesis (Text-to-Speech):** It provides the ability to recognize voice context from an audio input and respond. This is accessed by the `SpeechSynthesis` interface.
        For example, the below code is used to get voice/speech from text,

     ```javascript
     if ("speechSynthesis" in window) {
       var speech = new SpeechSynthesisUtterance("Hello World!");
       speech.lang = "en-US";
       window.speechSynthesis.speak(speech);
     }
     ```

     The above examples can be tested on chrome(33+) browser's developer console.
     **Note:** This API is still a working draft and only available in Chrome and Firefox browsers(ofcourse Chrome only implemented the specification)

388. ### What is minimum timeout throttling

     Both browser and NodeJS javascript environments throttles with a minimum delay that is greater than 0ms. That means even though setting a delay of 0ms will not happen instantaneously.
     **Browsers:** They have a minimum delay of 4ms. This throttle occurs when successive calls are triggered due to callback nesting(certain depth) or after a certain number of successive intervals.
     Note: The older browsers have a minimum delay of 10ms.
     **Nodejs:** They have a minimum delay of 1ms. This throttle happens when the delay is larger than 2147483647 or less than 1.
     The best example to explain this timeout throttling behavior is the order of below code snippet.

     ```javascript
     function runMeFirst() {
       console.log("My script is initialized");
     }
     setTimeout(runMeFirst, 0);
     console.log("Script loaded");
     ```

     and the output would be in

     ```cmd
     Script loaded
     My script is initialized
     ```

     If you don't use `setTimeout`, the order of logs will be sequential.

     ```javascript
     function runMeFirst() {
       console.log("My script is initialized");
     }
     runMeFirst();
     console.log("Script loaded");
     ```

     and the output is,

     ```cmd
     My script is initialized
     Script loaded
     ```

389. ### How do you implement zero timeout in modern browsers

     You can't use setTimeout(fn, 0) to execute the code immediately due to minimum delay of greater than 0ms. But you can use window.postMessage() to achieve this behavior.

390. ### What are tasks in event loop

     A task is any javascript code/program which is scheduled to be run by the standard mechanisms such as initially starting to run a program, run an event callback, or an interval or timeout being fired. All these tasks are scheduled on a task queue.
     Below are the list of use cases to add tasks to the task queue,

     1. When a new javascript program is executed directly from console or running by the `<script>` element, the task will be added to the task queue.
     2. When an event fires, the event callback added to task queue
     3. When a setTimeout or setInterval is reached, the corresponding callback added to task queue

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

391. ### What is microtask
     
     A microtask is a type of JavaScript callback that is scheduled to run immediately after the currently executing script and before the next event loop tick. Microtasks are executed after the current task completes and before any new tasks (macrotasks) are run. This ensures a fast and predictable update cycle.

     Common sources of microtasks stored in the microtask queue include:

     1. **Promises:**
        When a Promise is resolved or rejected, its `.then()`, `.catch()`, and `.finally()` callbacks are placed in the microtask queue.

        ```javascript
        Promise.resolve().then(() => {
         console.log('Microtask from a Promise');
        });
        ```

      2. **queueMicrotask():**
     
         A method that explicitly schedules a function to be run in the microtask queue.

         ```javascript
          queueMicrotask(() => {
             console.log('Microtask from  queueMicrotask');
           });
         ```

      3. **MutationObserver callbacks:**

         Observers changes in the DOM and triggers a callback as a microtask.

         ```javascript
            const observer = new MutationObserver(() => {
              console.log('Microtask from MutationObserver');
            })
            observer.observe(document.body, {childList: true});
         ```

      4. **await:**  
         Await internally uses Promises, so the code after `await` is scheduled as a microtask.

         ```javascript
          async function asyncFunction() {
            await null;
            console.log('Microtask from Await'); // Schedule this code as microtask
          }
         ```
     **Note:** All of these microtasks are processed in the same turn of the event loop.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

392. ### What are different event loops

     In JavaScript, there are multiple event loops that can be used depending on the context of your application. The most common event loops are:

     1. The Browser Event Loop
     2. The Node.js Event Loop

- Browser Event Loop: The Browser Event Loop is used in client-side JavaScript applications and is responsible for handling events that occur within the browser environment, such as user interactions (clicks, keypresses, etc.), HTTP requests, and other asynchronous actions.

- The Node.js Event Loop is used in server-side JavaScript applications and is responsible for handling events that occur within the Node.js runtime environment, such as file I/O, network I/O, and other asynchronous actions.

  **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

393. ### What is the purpose of queueMicrotask

     The `queueMicrotask` function is used to schedule a microtask, which is a function that will be executed asynchronously in the microtask queue. The purpose of `queueMicrotask` is to ensure that a function is executed after the current task has finished, but before the browser performs any rendering or handles user events.

     Example:

     ```javascript
     console.log("Start"); //1

     queueMicrotask(() => {
       console.log("Inside microtask"); // 3
     });

     console.log("End"); //2
     ```

     By using queueMicrotask, you can ensure that certain tasks or callbacks are executed at the earliest opportunity during the JavaScript event loop, making it useful for performing work that needs to be done asynchronously but with higher priority than regular `setTimeout` or `setInterval` callbacks.

394. ### How do you use javascript libraries in typescript file

     It is known that not all JavaScript libraries or frameworks have TypeScript declaration files. But if you still want to use libraries or frameworks in your TypeScript files without getting compilation errors, the only solution is `declare` keyword along with a variable declaration. For example, let's imagine you have a library called `customLibrary` that doesn’t have a TypeScript declaration and have a namespace called `customLibrary` in the global namespace. You can use this library in typescript code as below,

     ```javascript
     declare var customLibrary;
     ```

     In the runtime, typescript will provide the type to the `customLibrary` variable as `any` type. The another alternative without using declare keyword is below

     ```javascript
     var customLibrary: any;
     ```

395. ### What are the differences between promises and observables

     Some of the major difference in a tabular form

     | Promises                                                           | Observables                                                                              |
     | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
     | Emits only a single value at a time                                | Emits multiple values over a period of time(stream of values ranging from 0 to multiple) |
     | Eager in nature; they are going to be called immediately           | Lazy in nature; they require subscription to be invoked                                  |
     | Promise is always asynchronous even though it resolved immediately | Observable can be either synchronous or asynchronous                                     |
     | Doesn't provide any operators                                      | Provides operators such as map, forEach, filter, reduce, retry, and retryWhen etc        |
     | Cannot be canceled                                                 | Canceled by using unsubscribe() method                                                   |

396. ### What is heap

     Heap(Or memory heap) is the memory location where objects are stored when we define variables. i.e, This is the place where all the memory allocations and de-allocation take place. Both heap and call-stack are two containers of JS runtime.
     Whenever runtime comes across variables and function declarations in the code it stores them in the Heap.

397. ### What is an event table

     Event Table is a data structure that stores and keeps track of all the events which will be executed asynchronously like after some time interval or after the resolution of some API requests. i.e Whenever you call a setTimeout function or invoke async operation, it is added to the Event Table.
     It doesn't not execute functions on it’s own. The main purpose of the event table is to keep track of events and send them to the Event Queue as shown in the below diagram.

398. ### What is a microTask queue

     Microtask Queue is the new queue where all the tasks initiated by promise objects get processed before the callback queue.
     The microtasks queue are processed before the next rendering and painting jobs. But if these microtasks are running for a long time then it leads to visual degradation.

399. ### What is the difference between shim and polyfill

     A shim is a library that brings a new API to an older environment, using only the means of that environment. It isn't necessarily restricted to a web application. For example, es5-shim.js is used to emulate ES5 features on older browsers (mainly pre IE9).
     Whereas polyfill is a piece of code (or plugin) that provides the technology that you, the developer, expect the browser to provide natively.
     In a simple sentence, a polyfill is a shim for a browser API.

400. ### How do you detect primitive or non primitive value type

     In JavaScript, primitive types include boolean, string, number, BigInt, null, Symbol and undefined. Whereas non-primitive types include the Objects. But you can easily identify them with the below function,

     ```javascript
     var myPrimitive = 30;
     var myNonPrimitive = {};
     function isPrimitive(val) {
       return Object(val) !== val;
     }

     isPrimitive(myPrimitive);
     isPrimitive(myNonPrimitive);
     ```

     If the value is a primitive data type, the Object constructor creates a new wrapper object for the value. But If the value is a non-primitive data type (an object), the Object constructor will give the same object.

401. ### What is babel

     Babel is a JavaScript transpiler to convert ECMAScript 2015+ code into a backwards compatible version of JavaScript in current and older browsers or environments. Some of the main features are listed below,

     1. Transform syntax
     2. Polyfill features that are missing in your target environment (using @babel/polyfill)
     3. Source code transformations (or codemods)

402. ### Is Node.js completely single threaded

     Node is a single thread, but some of the functions included in the Node.js standard library(e.g, fs module functions) are not single threaded. i.e, Their logic runs outside of the Node.js single thread to improve the speed and performance of a program.

403. ### What are the common use cases of observables

     Some of the most common use cases of observables are web sockets with push notifications, user input changes, repeating intervals, etc

404. ### What is RxJS

     RxJS (Reactive Extensions for JavaScript) is a library for implementing reactive programming using observables that makes it easier to compose asynchronous or callback-based code. It also provides utility functions for creating and working with observables.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

405. ### What is the difference between Function constructor and function declaration

     The functions which are created with `Function constructor` do not create closures to their creation contexts but they are always created in the global scope. i.e, the function can access its own local variables and global scope variables only. Whereas function declarations can access outer function variables(closures) too.

     Let's see this difference with an example,

     **Function Constructor:**

     ```javascript
     var a = 100;
     function createFunction() {
       var a = 200;
       return new Function("return a;");
     }
     console.log(createFunction()()); // 100
     ```

     **Function declaration:**

     ```javascript
     var a = 100;
     function createFunction() {
       var a = 200;
       return function func() {
         return a;
       };
     }
     console.log(createFunction()()); // 200
     ```

406. ### What is a Short circuit condition

     Short circuit conditions are meant for condensed way of writing simple if statements. Let's demonstrate the scenario using an example. If you would like to login to a portal with an authentication condition, the expression would be as below,

     ```javascript
     if (authenticate) {
       loginToPorta();
     }
     ```

     Since the javascript logical operators evaluated from left to right, the above expression can be simplified using && logical operator

     ```javascript
     authenticate && loginToPorta();
     ```

407. ### What is the easiest way to resize an array

     The length property of an array is useful to resize or empty an array quickly. Let's apply length property on number array to resize the number of elements from 5 to 2,

     ```javascript
     var array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
     console.log(array.length); // 5

     array.length = 2;
     console.log(array.length); // 2
     console.log(array); // [1,2]
     ```

     and the array can be emptied too

     ```javascript
     var array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
     array.length = 0;
     console.log(array.length); // 0
     console.log(array); // []
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

408. ### What is an observable

     An Observable is basically a function that can return a stream of values either synchronously or asynchronously to an observer over time. The consumer can get the value by calling `subscribe()` method.
     Let's look at a simple example of an Observable

     ```javascript
     import { Observable } from "rxjs";

     const observable = new Observable((observer) => {
       setTimeout(() => {
         observer.next("Message from a Observable!");
       }, 3000);
     });

     observable.subscribe((value) => console.log(value));
     ```

     ![Screenshot](images/observables.png)

     **Note:** Observables are not part of the JavaScript language yet but they are being proposed to be added to the language

409. ### What is the difference between function and class declarations

     The main difference between function declarations and class declarations is `hoisting`. The function declarations are hoisted but not class declarations.

     **Classes:**

     ```javascript
     const user = new User(); // ReferenceError

     class User {}
     ```

     **Constructor Function:**

     ```javascript
     const user = new User(); // No error

     function User() {}
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

410. ### What is an async function

     An async function is a function declared with the `async` keyword which enables asynchronous, promise-based behavior to be written in a cleaner style by avoiding promise chains. These functions can contain zero or more `await` expressions.

     Let's take a below async function example,

     ```javascript
     async function logger() {
       let data = await fetch("http://someapi.com/users"); // pause until fetch returns
       console.log(data);
     }
     logger();
     ```

     It is basically syntax sugar over ES2015 promises and generators.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

411. ### How do you prevent promises swallowing errors

     While using asynchronous code, JavaScript’s ES6 promises can make your life a lot easier without having callback pyramids and error handling on every second line. But Promises have some pitfalls and the biggest one is swallowing errors by default.

     Let's say you expect to print an error to the console for all the below cases,

     ```javascript
     Promise.resolve("promised value").then(function () {
       throw new Error("error");
     });

     Promise.reject("error value").catch(function () {
       throw new Error("error");
     });

     new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {
       throw new Error("error");
     });
     ```

     But there are many modern JavaScript environments that won't print any errors. You can fix this problem in different ways,

     1. **Add catch block at the end of each chain:** You can add catch block to the end of each of your promise chains

        ```javascript
        Promise.resolve("promised value")
          .then(function () {
            throw new Error("error");
          })
          .catch(function (error) {
            console.error(error.stack);
          });
        ```

        But it is quite difficult to type for each promise chain and verbose too.

     2. **Add done method:** You can replace first solution's then and catch blocks with done method

        ```javascript
        Promise.resolve("promised value").done(function () {
          throw new Error("error");
        });
        ```

        Let's say you want to fetch data using HTTP and later perform processing on the resulting data asynchronously. You can write `done` block as below,

        ```javascript
        getDataFromHttp()
          .then(function (result) {
            return processDataAsync(result);
          })
          .done(function (processed) {
            displayData(processed);
          });
        ```

        In future, if the processing library API changed to synchronous then you can remove `done` block as below,

        ```javascript
        getDataFromHttp().then(function (result) {
          return displayData(processDataAsync(result));
        });
        ```

        and then you forgot to add `done` block to `then` block leads to silent errors.

     3. **Extend ES6 Promises by Bluebird:**
        Bluebird extends the ES6 Promises API to avoid the issue in the second solution. This library has a “default” onRejection handler which will print all errors from rejected Promises to stderr. After installation, you can process unhandled rejections

        ```javascript
        Promise.onPossiblyUnhandledRejection(function (error) {
          throw error;
        });
        ```

        and discard a rejection, just handle it with an empty catch

        ```javascript
        Promise.reject("error value").catch(function () {});
        ```

     Deno is a simple, modern and secure runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript that uses V8 JavaScript engine and the Rust programming language. It solves the inherent problems of Node.Js and has been officially released in May 2018. Unlike Node.JS, by default Deno executes the code in a sandbox, which means that runtime has no access to below areas:

     1. The file system
     2. The network
     3. Execution of other scripts
     4. The environment variables

413. ### How do you make an object iterable in javascript

     By default, plain objects are not iterable. But you can make the object iterable by defining a `Symbol.iterator` property on it.

     Let's demonstrate this with an example,

     ```javascript
     const collection = {
       one: 1,
       two: 2,
       three: 3,
       [Symbol.iterator]() {
         const values = Object.keys(this);
         let i = 0;
         return {
           next: () => {
             return {
               value: this[values[i++]],
               done: i > values.length,
             };
           },
         };
       },
     };

     const iterator = collection[Symbol.iterator]();

     console.log(iterator.next()); // → {value: 1, done: false}
     console.log(iterator.next()); // → {value: 2, done: false}
     console.log(iterator.next()); // → {value: 3, done: false}
     console.log(iterator.next()); // → {value: undefined, done: true}
     ```

     The above process can be simplified using a generator function,

     ```javascript
     const collection = {
       one: 1,
       two: 2,
       three: 3,
       [Symbol.iterator]: function* () {
         for (let key in this) {
           yield this[key];
         }
       },
     };
     const iterator = collection[Symbol.iterator]();
     console.log(iterator.next()); // {value: 1, done: false}
     console.log(iterator.next()); // {value: 2, done: false}
     console.log(iterator.next()); // {value: 3, done: false}
     console.log(iterator.next()); // {value: undefined, done: true}
     ```

414. ### What is a Proper Tail Call

     First, we should know about tail call before talking about "Proper Tail Call". A tail call is a subroutine or function call performed as the final action of a calling function. Whereas **Proper tail call(PTC)** is a technique where the program or code will not create additional stack frames for a recursion when the function call is a tail call.

     For example, the below classic or head recursion of factorial function relies on stack for each step. Each step need to be processed upto `n * factorial(n - 1)`

     ```javascript
     function factorial(n) {
       if (n === 0) {
         return 1;
       }
       return n * factorial(n - 1);
     }
     console.log(factorial(5)); //120
     ```

     But if you use Tail recursion functions, they keep passing all the necessary data it needs down the recursion without relying on the stack.

     ```javascript
     function factorial(n, acc = 1) {
       if (n === 0) {
         return acc;
       }
       return factorial(n - 1, n * acc);
     }
     console.log(factorial(5)); //120
     ```

     The above pattern returns the same output as the first one. But the accumulator keeps track of total as an argument without using stack memory on recursive calls.

415. ### How do you check an object is a promise or not

     If you don't know if a value is a promise or not, wrapping the value as `Promise.resolve(value)` which returns a promise

     ```javascript
     function isPromise(object) {
       if (Promise && Promise.resolve) {
         return Promise.resolve(object) == object;
       } else {
         throw "Promise not supported in your environment";
       }
     }

     var i = 1;
     var promise = new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {
       resolve();
     });

     console.log(isPromise(i)); // false
     console.log(isPromise(promise)); // true
     ```

     Another way is to check for `.then()` handler type

     ```javascript
     function isPromise(value) {
       return Boolean(value && typeof value.then === "function");
     }
     var i = 1;
     var promise = new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {
       resolve();
     });

     console.log(isPromise(i)); // false
     console.log(isPromise(promise)); // true
     ```

416. ### How to detect if a function is called as constructor

     You can use `new.target` pseudo-property to detect whether a function was called as a constructor(using the new operator) or as a regular function call.

     1. If a constructor or function invoked using the new operator, new.target returns a reference to the constructor or function.
     2. For function calls, new.target is undefined.

     ```javascript
     function Myfunc() {
       if (new.target) {
         console.log("called with new");
       } else {
         console.log("not called with new");
       }
     }

     new Myfunc(); // called with new
     Myfunc(); // not called with new
     Myfunc.call({}); // not called with new
     ```

417. ### What are the differences between arguments object and rest parameter

     There are three main differences between arguments object and rest parameters

     1. The arguments object is an array-like but not an array. Whereas the rest parameters are array instances.
     2. The arguments object does not support methods such as sort, map, forEach, or pop. Whereas these methods can be used in rest parameters.
     3. The rest parameters are only the ones that haven’t been given a separate name, while the arguments object contains all arguments passed to the function

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

418. ### What are the differences between spread operator and rest parameter

     Rest parameter collects all remaining elements into an array. Whereas Spread operator allows iterables( arrays / objects / strings ) to be expanded into single arguments/elements. i.e, Rest parameter is opposite to the spread operator.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

419. ### What are the different kinds of generators

     There are five kinds of generators,

     1. **Generator function declaration:**

        ```javascript
        function* myGenFunc() {
          yield 1;
          yield 2;
          yield 3;
        }
        const genObj = myGenFunc();
        ```

     2. **Generator function expressions:**

        ```javascript
        const myGenFunc = function* () {
          yield 1;
          yield 2;
          yield 3;
        };
        const genObj = myGenFunc();
        ```

     3. **Generator method definitions in object literals:**

        ```javascript
        const myObj = {
          *myGeneratorMethod() {
            yield 1;
            yield 2;
            yield 3;
          },
        };
        const genObj = myObj.myGeneratorMethod();
        ```

     4. **Generator method definitions in class:**

        ```javascript
        class MyClass {
          *myGeneratorMethod() {
            yield 1;
            yield 2;
            yield 3;
          }
        }
        const myObject = new MyClass();
        const genObj = myObject.myGeneratorMethod();
        ```

     5. **Generator as a computed property:**

        ```javascript
        const SomeObj = {
          *[Symbol.iterator]() {
            yield 1;
            yield 2;
            yield 3;
          },
        };

        console.log(Array.from(SomeObj)); // [ 1, 2, 3 ]
        ```

420. ### What are the built-in iterables

     Below are the list of built-in iterables in javascript,

     1. Arrays and TypedArrays
     2. Strings: Iterate over each character or Unicode code-points
     3. Maps: iterate over its key-value pairs
     4. Sets: iterates over their elements
     5. arguments: An array-like special variable in functions
     6. DOM collection such as NodeList

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

421. ### What are the differences between for...of and for...in statements

     Both for...in and for...of statements iterate over js data structures. The only difference is over what they iterate:

     1. for..in iterates over all enumerable property keys of an object
     2. for..of iterates over the values of an iterable object.

     Let's explain this difference with an example,

     ```javascript
     let arr = ["a", "b", "c"];

     arr.newProp = "newVlue";

     // key are the property keys
     for (let key in arr) {
       console.log(key); // 0, 1, 2 & newProp
     }

     // value are the property values
     for (let value of arr) {
       console.log(value); // a, b, c
     }
     ```

     Since for..in loop iterates over the keys of the object, the first loop logs 0, 1, 2 and newProp while iterating over the array object. The for..of loop iterates over the values of a arr data structure and logs a, b, c in the console.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

422. ### How do you define instance and non-instance properties

     The Instance properties must be defined inside of class methods. For example, name and age properties defined inside constructor as below,

     ```javascript
     class Person {
       constructor(name, age) {
         this.name = name;
         this.age = age;
       }
     }
     ```

     But Static(class) and prototype data properties must be defined outside of the ClassBody declaration. Let's assign the age value for Person class as below,

     ```javascript
     Person.staticAge = 30;
     Person.prototype.prototypeAge = 40;
     ```

423. ### What is the difference between isNaN and Number.isNaN?

     1. **isNaN**: The global function `isNaN` converts the argument to a Number and returns true if the resulting value is NaN.
     2. **Number.isNaN**: This method does not convert the argument. But it returns true when the type is a Number and value is NaN.

     Let's see the difference with an example,

     ```javascript
     isNaN(‘hello’);   // true
     Number.isNaN('hello'); // false
     ```

424. ### How to invoke an IIFE without any extra brackets?

     Immediately Invoked Function Expressions(IIFE) requires a pair of parenthesis to wrap the function which contains set of statements.

     ```js
     (function (dt) {
       console.log(dt.toLocaleTimeString());
     })(new Date());
     ```

     Since both IIFE and void operator discard the result of an expression, you can avoid the extra brackets using `void operator` for IIFE as below,

     ```js
     void (function (dt) {
       console.log(dt.toLocaleTimeString());
     })(new Date());
     ```

425. ### Is that possible to use expressions in switch cases?

     You might have seen expressions used in switch condition but it is also possible to use for switch cases by assigning true value for the switch condition. Let's see the weather condition based on temperature as an example,

     ```js
     const weather = (function getWeather(temp) {
       switch (true) {
         case temp < 0:
           return "freezing";
         case temp < 10:
           return "cold";
         case temp < 24:
           return "cool";
         default:
           return "unknown";
       }
     })(10);
     ```

426. ### What is the easiest way to ignore promise errors?

     The easiest and safest way to ignore promise errors is void that error. This approach is ESLint friendly too.

     ```js
     await promise.catch((e) => void e);
     ```

427. ### How do style the console output using CSS?

     You can add CSS styling to the console output using the CSS format content specifier %c. The console string message can be appended after the specifier and CSS style in another argument. Let's print the red color text using console.log and CSS specifier as below,

     ```js
     console.log("%cThis is a red text", "color:red");
     ```

     It is also possible to add more styles for the content. For example, the font-size can be modified for the above text

     ```js
     console.log(
       "%cThis is a red text with bigger font",
       "color:red; font-size:20px"
     );
     ```

428. ### What is nullish coalescing operator (??)?

     It is a logical operator that returns its right-hand side operand when its left-hand side operand is null or undefined, and otherwise returns its left-hand side operand. This can be contrasted with the logical OR (||) operator, which returns the right-hand side operand if the left operand is any falsy value, not only null or undefined.

     ```js
     console.log(null ?? true); // true
     console.log(false ?? true); // false
     console.log(undefined ?? true); // true
     ```

429. ### How do you group and nest console output?

     The `console.group()` can be used to group related log messages to be able to easily read the logs and use console.groupEnd()to close the group. Along with this, you can also nest groups which allows to output message in hierarchical manner.

     For example, if you’re logging a user’s details:

     ```js
     console.group("User Details");
     console.log("name: Sudheer Jonna");
     console.log("job: Software Developer");

     // Nested Group
     console.group("Address");
     console.log("Street: Commonwealth");
     console.log("City: Los Angeles");
     console.log("State: California");

     // Close nested group
     console.groupEnd();

     // Close outer group
     console.groupEnd();
     ```

     You can also use `console.groupCollapsed()` instead of `console.group()` if you want the groups to be collapsed by default.

430. ### What is the difference between dense and sparse arrays?

     An array contains items at each index starting from first(0) to last(array.length - 1) is called as Dense array. Whereas if at least one item is missing at any index, the array is called as sparse.

     Let's see the below two kind of arrays,

     ```js
     const avengers = ["Ironman", "Hulk", "CaptainAmerica"];
     console.log(avengers[0]); // 'Ironman'
     console.log(avengers[1]); // 'Hulk'
     console.log(avengers[2]); // 'CaptainAmerica'
     console.log(avengers.length); // 3

     const justiceLeague = ["Superman", "Aquaman", , "Batman"];
     console.log(justiceLeague[0]); // 'Superman'
     console.log(justiceLeague[1]); // 'Aquaman'
     console.log(justiceLeague[2]); // undefined
     console.log(justiceLeague[3]); // 'Batman'
     console.log(justiceLeague.length); // 4
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

431. ### What are the different ways to create sparse arrays?

     There are 4 different ways to create sparse arrays in JavaScript

     1. **Array literal:** Omit a value when using the array literal
        ```js
        const justiceLeague = ["Superman", "Aquaman", , "Batman"];
        console.log(justiceLeague); // ['Superman', 'Aquaman', empty ,'Batman']
        ```
     2. **Array() constructor:** Invoking Array(length) or new Array(length)
        ```js
        const array = Array(3);
        console.log(array); // [empty, empty ,empty]
        ```
     3. **Delete operator:** Using delete array[index] operator on the array
        ```js
        const justiceLeague = ["Superman", "Aquaman", "Batman"];
        delete justiceLeague[1];
        console.log(justiceLeague); // ['Superman', empty, ,'Batman']
        ```
     4. **Increase length property:** Increasing length property of an array
        ```js
        const justiceLeague = ["Superman", "Aquaman", "Batman"];
        justiceLeague.length = 5;
        console.log(justiceLeague); // ['Superman', 'Aquaman', 'Batman', empty, empty]
        ```

432. ### What is the difference between setTimeout, setImmediate and process.nextTick?

     1. **Set Timeout:** setTimeout() is to schedule execution of a one-time callback after delay milliseconds.
     2. **Set Immediate:** The setImmediate function is used to execute a function right after the current event loop finishes.
     3. **Process NextTick:** If process.nextTick() is called in a given phase, all the callbacks passed to process.nextTick() will be resolved before the event loop continues. This will block the event loop and create I/O Starvation if process.nextTick() is called recursively.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

433. ### How do you reverse an array without modifying original array?

     The `reverse()` method reverses the order of the elements in an array but it mutates the original array. Let's take a simple example to demonistrate this case,

     ```javascript
     const originalArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
     const newArray = originalArray.reverse();

     console.log(newArray); // [ 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
     console.log(originalArray); // [ 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
     ```

     There are few solutions that won't mutate the original array. Let's take a look.

     1. **Using slice and reverse methods:**
        In this case, just invoke the `slice()` method on the array to create a shallow copy followed by `reverse()` method call on the copy.

        ```javascript
        const originalArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
        const newArray = originalArray.slice().reverse(); //Slice an array gives a new copy

        console.log(originalArray); // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
        console.log(newArray); // [ 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
        ```

     2. **Using spread and reverse methods:**
        In this case, let's use the spread syntax (...) to create a copy of the array followed by `reverse()` method call on the copy.

        ```javascript
        const originalArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
        const newArray = [...originalArray].reverse();

        console.log(originalArray); // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
        console.log(newArray); // [ 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
        ```

     3. **Using reduce and spread methods:**
        Here execute a reducer function on an array elements and append the accumulated array on right side using spread syntax

        ```javascript
        const originalArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
        const newArray = originalArray.reduce((accumulator, value) => {
          return [value, ...accumulator];
        }, []);

        console.log(originalArray); // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
        console.log(newArray); // [ 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
        ```

     4. **Using reduceRight and spread methods:**
        Here execute a right reducer function(i.e. opposite direction of reduce method) on an array elements and append the accumulated array on left side using spread syntax

        ```javascript
        const originalArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
        const newArray = originalArray.reduceRight((accumulator, value) => {
          return [...accumulator, value];
        }, []);

        console.log(originalArray); // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
        console.log(newArray); // [ 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
        ```

     5. **Using reduceRight and push methods:**
        Here execute a right reducer function(i.e. opposite direction of reduce method) on an array elements and push the iterated value to the accumulator

        ```javascript
        const originalArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
        const newArray = originalArray.reduceRight((accumulator, value) => {
          accumulator.push(value);
          return accumulator;
        }, []);

        console.log(originalArray); // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
        console.log(newArray); // [ 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
        ```

434. ### How do you create custom HTML element?

     The creation of custom HTML elements involves two main steps,

     1. **Define your custom HTML element:** First you need to define some custom class by extending HTMLElement class.
        After that define your component properties (styles,text etc) using `connectedCallback` method.
        **Note:** The browser exposes a function called `customElements.define` inorder to reuse the element.
        ```javascript
        class CustomElement extends HTMLElement {
          connectedCallback() {
            this.innerHTML = "This is a custom element";
          }
        }
        customElements.define("custom-element", CustomElement);
        ```
     2. **Use custom element just like other HTML element:** Declare your custom element as a HTML tag.

     ```javascript
        <body>
             <custom-element>
        </body>
     ```

435. ### What is global execution context?

     The global execution context is the default or first execution context that is created by the JavaScript engine before any code is executed(i.e, when the file first loads in the browser). All the global code that is not inside a function or object will be executed inside this global execution context. Since JS engine is single threaded there will be only one global environment and there will be only one global execution context.

     For example, the below code other than code inside any function or object is executed inside the global execution context.

     ```javascript
     var x = 10;

     function A() {
       console.log("Start function A");

       function B() {
         console.log("In function B");
       }

       B();
     }

     A();

     console.log("GlobalContext");
     ```

436. ### What is function execution context?

     Whenever a function is invoked, the JavaScript engine creates a different type of Execution Context known as a Function Execution Context (FEC) within the Global Execution Context (GEC) to evaluate and execute the code within that function.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

437. ### What is debouncing?

    Debouncing is a programming technique used to limit how often a function is executed. Specifically, it ensures that a function is only triggered after a certain amount of time has passed since it was last invoked. This prevents unnecessary or excessive function calls, which can help optimize performance and reduce unnecessary CPU usage or API requests.

    For example, when a user types in a search box, you typically want to wait until they’ve finished typing before fetching suggestions. Without debouncing, an API call would be triggered on every keystroke, potentially causing performance issues. With debouncing, the function call is postponed until the user stops typing for a specified period (e.g., 300ms). If the user types again before this time elapses, the timer resets.

    **Typical use cases for debouncing include:**

    *   Search box suggestions (wait until typing pauses before fetching results)
    *   Auto-saving text fields (save only after the user stops typing)
    *   Preventing double-clicks on buttons
    *   Handling window resize or scroll events efficiently

    **Example Debounce Function:**

    JavaScript

    ```css
    function debounce(func, timeout = 500) {
      let timer;
      return function (...args) {
        clearTimeout(timer);
        timer = setTimeout(() => {
          func.apply(this, args);
        }, timeout);
      };
    }
    ```

    **Usage Example:**

    JavaScript

    ```css
    function fetchResults() {
      console.log("Fetching input suggestions");
    }
    const processChange = debounce(fetchResults, 300);

    // Attach to input element
    <input type="text" onkeyup="processChange()" />

    // Attach to button
    <button onclick="processChange()">Click me</button>

    // Attach to window event
    window.addEventListener("scroll", processChange);
    ```

    **How it works:**  
    When `processChange` is invoked (e.g., by typing or clicking), any pending execution is canceled, and the function is scheduled to run after the specified delay. If another event occurs before the delay is up, the timer resets, and the function will only run after events have stopped for the delay duration.

    Debouncing is an essential tool for improving user experience and application performance, especially when dealing with events that can fire rapidly and repeatedly.

438. ### What is throttling?
      Throttling is a programming technique used to control the rate at which a function is executed. When an event is triggered continuously—such as during window resizing, scrolling, or mouse movement—throttling ensures that the associated event handler is not called more often than a specified interval. This helps improve performance by reducing the number of expensive function calls and preventing performance bottlenecks.

      **Common use cases:**

      *   Window resize events
      *   Scroll events
      *   Mouse movement or drag events
      *   API rate limiting

      **How does throttling work?**  
      Throttling will execute the function at most once every specified time interval, ignoring additional calls until the interval has passed.

      **Example: Throttle Implementation and Usage**

      JavaScript

      ```css
      // Simple throttle function: allows 'func' to run at most once every 'limit' ms
      function throttle(func, limit) {
        let inThrottle = false;
        return function(...args) {
          if (!inThrottle) {
            func.apply(this, args);
            inThrottle = true;
            setTimeout(() => (inThrottle = false), limit);
          }
        };
      }

      // Usage: throttling a scroll event handler
      function handleScrollAnimation() {
        console.log('Scroll event triggered');
      }

      window.addEventListener(
        "scroll",
        throttle(handleScrollAnimation, 100) // Will run at most once every 100ms
      );
      ```

439. ### What is optional chaining?

     According to MDN official docs, the optional chaining operator (?.) permits reading the value of a property located deep within a chain of connected objects without having to expressly validate that each reference in the chain is valid.

     The ?. operator is like the . chaining operator, except that instead of causing an error if a reference is nullish (null or undefined), the expression short-circuits with a return value of undefined. When used with function calls, it returns undefined if the given function does not exist.

     ```js
     const adventurer = {
       name: "Alice",
       cat: {
         name: "Dinah",
       },
     };

     const dogName = adventurer.dog?.name;
     console.log(dogName);
     // expected output: undefined

     console.log(adventurer.someNonExistentMethod?.());
     // expected output: undefined
     ```

440. ### What is an environment record?

     According to ECMAScript specification 262 (9.1):

     > [Environment Record](https://262.ecma-international.org/12.0/#sec-environment-records) is a specification type used to define the association of Identifiers to specific variables and functions, based upon the lexical nesting structure of ECMAScript code.

     Usually an Environment Record is associated with some specific syntactic structure of ECMAScript code such as a FunctionDeclaration, a BlockStatement, or a Catch clause of a TryStatement.

     Each time such code is evaluated, a new Environment Record is created to record the identifier bindings that are created by that code.

441. ### How to verify if a variable is an array?

     It is possible to check if a variable is an array instance using 3 different ways,

     1. Array.isArray() method:

        The `Array.isArray(value)` utility function is used to determine whether value is an array or not. This function returns a true boolean value if the variable is an array and a false value if it is not.

        ```javascript
        const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
        const user = { name: "John" };
        Array.isArray(numbers); // true
        Array.isArray(user); //false
        ```

     2. instanceof operator:

        The instanceof operator is used to check the type of an array at run time. It returns true if the type of a variable is an Array other false for other type.

        ```javascript
        const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
        const user = { name: "John" };
        console.log(numbers instanceof Array); // true
        console.log(user instanceof Array); // false
        ```

     3. Checking constructor type:

        The constructor property of the variable is used to determine whether the variable Array type or not.

        ```javascript
        const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
        const user = { name: "John" };
        console.log(numbers.constructor === Array); // true
        console.log(user.constructor === Array); // false
        ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

442. ### What is pass by value and pass by reference?

     Pass-by-value creates a new space in memory and makes a copy of a value. Primitives such as string, number, boolean etc will actually create a new copy. Hence, updating one value doesn't impact the other value. i.e, The values are independent of each other.

     ```javascript
     let a = 5;
     let b = a;

     b++;
     console.log(a, b); //5, 6
     ```

     In the above code snippet, the value of `a` is assigned to `b` and the variable `b` has been incremented. Since there is a new space created for variable `b`, any update on this variable doesn't impact the variable `a`.

     Pass by reference doesn't create a new space in memory but the new variable adopts a memory address of an initial variable. Non-primitives such as objects, arrays and functions gets the reference of the initiable variable. i.e, updating one value will impact the other variable.

     ```javascript
     let user1 = {
       name: "John",
       age: 27,
     };
     let user2 = user1;
     user2.age = 30;

     console.log(user1.age, user2.age); // 30, 30
     ```

     In the above code snippet, updating the `age` property of one object will impact the other property due to the same reference.

443. ### What are the differences between primitives and non-primitives?

     JavaScript language has both primitives and non-primitives but there are few differences between them as below,

     | Primitives                 | Non-primitives       |
     | -------------------------- | -------------------- |
     | These types are predefined | Created by developer |
     | These are immutable        | Mutable              |
     | Compare by value           | Compare by reference |
     | Stored in Stack            | Stored in heap       |
     | Contain certain value      | Can contain NULL too |

444. ### How do you create your own bind method using either call or apply method?

     The custom bind function needs to be created on Function prototype inorder to use it as other builtin functions. This custom function should return a function similar to original bind method and the implementation of inner function needs to use apply method call.

     The function which is going to bind using custom `myOwnBind` method act as the attached function(`boundTargetFunction`) and argument as the object for `apply` method call.

     ```js
     Function.prototype.myOwnBind = function (whoIsCallingMe) {
       if (typeof this !== "function") {
         throw new Error(this + "cannot be bound as it's not callable");
       }
       const boundTargetFunction = this;
       return function () {
         boundTargetFunction.apply(whoIsCallingMe, arguments);
       };
     };
     ```

445. ### What are the differences between pure and impure functions?

     Some of the major differences between pure and impure function are as below,

| Pure function                       | Impure function                                                        |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| It has no side effects              | It causes side effects                                                 |
| It is always return the same result | It returns different result on each call                               |
| Easy to read and debug              | Difficult to read and debug because they are affected by external code |

446. ### What is referential transparency?

An expression in javascript that can be replaced by its value without affecting the behaviour of the program is called referential transparency. Pure functions are referentially transparent.

```javascript
const add = (x, y) => x + y;
const multiplyBy2 = (x) => x * 2;

//Now add (2, 3) can be replaced by 5.

multiplyBy2(add(2, 3));
```

447. ### What are the possible side-effects in javascript?

     A side effect is the modification of the state through the invocation of a function or expression. These side effects make our function impure by default. Below are some side effects which make function impure,

- Making an HTTP request. Asynchronous functions such as fetch and promise are impure.
- DOM manipulations
- Mutating the input data
- Printing to a screen or console: For example, console.log() and alert()
- Fetching the current time
- Math.random() calls: Modifies the internal state of Math object

448. ### What are compose and pipe functions?

     The "compose" and "pipe" are two techniques commonly used in functional programming to simplify complex operations and make code more readable. They are not native to JavaScript and higher-order functions. the `compose()` applies right to left any number of functions to the output of the previous function.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

449. ### What is module pattern?

     Module pattern is a designed pattern used to wrap a set of variables and functions together in a single scope returned as an object. JavaScript doesn't have access specifiers similar to other languages(Java, Python, etc) to provide private scope. It uses IIFE (Immediately invoked function expression) to allow for private scopes. i.e., a closure that protect variables and methods.

     The module pattern looks like below,

     ```javascript
     (function () {
       // Private variables or functions goes here.

       return {
         // Return public variables or functions here.
       };
     })();
     ```

     Let's see an example of a module pattern for an employee with private and public access,

     ```javascript
     const createEmployee = (function () {
       // Private
       const name = "John";
       const department = "Sales";
       const getEmployeeName = () => name;
       const getDepartmentName = () => department;

       // Public
       return {
         name,
         department,
         getName: () => getEmployeeName(),
         getDepartment: () => getDepartmentName(),
       };
     })();

     console.log(createEmployee.name);
     console.log(createEmployee.department);
     console.log(createEmployee.getName());
     console.log(createEmployee.getDepartment());
     ```

     **Note:** It mimic the concepts of classes with private variables and methods.

450. ### What is Function Composition?

     It is an approach where the result of one function is passed on to the next function, which is passed to another until the final function is executed for the final result.

     ```javascript
     //example
     const double = (x) => x * 2;
     const square = (x) => x * x;

     var output1 = double(2);
     var output2 = square(output1);
     console.log(output2);

     var output_final = square(double(2));
     console.log(output_final);
     ```

451. ### How to use await outside of async function prior to ES2022?

     Prior to ES2022, if you attempted to use an await outside of an async function resulted in a SyntaxError.

     ```javascript
     await Promise.resolve(console.log("Hello await")); // SyntaxError: await is only valid in async function
     ```

     But you can fix this issue with an alternative IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) to get access to the feature.

     ```javascript
     (async function () {
       await Promise.resolve(console.log("Hello await")); // Hello await
     })();
     ```

     In ES2022, you can write top-level await without writing any hacks.

     ```javascript
     await Promise.resolve(console.log("Hello await")); //Hello await
     ```

452. ### What is the purpose of the this keyword in JavaScript?
The `this` keyword in JavaScript refers to **the object that is executing the current function**. Its value is determined by **how a function is called**, not where it is defined.  `this` is essential for writing object-oriented and event-driven code, as it allows methods to interact with the data of the object they belong to.


  **Example 1: this in a Global Context**

  ```javascript
  console.log(this);
  ```

  - In a global context, this refers to the global object (e.g., window in a browser).

  **Example 2: this in a Function**

  ```javascript
  function displayThis() {
    console.log(this);
  }

  displayThis();
  ```

  - In a regular function, this refers to the global object(window in browser and global in nodejs) for non-strict mode.  In strict mode, it's value is undefined.

  **Example 3: this in a Method**

  ```javascript
  const person = {
    name: "John",
    greet: function () {
      console.log("Hello, " + this.name);
    },
  };

  person.greet();
  ```

  - In a method, this refers to the object that owns the method (person in the case).

  **Example 4: this in an Event Handler**

  ```javascript
   document.getElementById("myButton").addEventListener("click", function () {
            console.log(this);
   });
  ```

  - In an event handler, this refers to the element that triggered the event (the button in this case).

  **Example 5: `this` with Arrow Functions**

  ```javascript
        const obj = {
          age: 42,
          regular: function() { console.log(this.age); },
          arrow: () => { console.log(this.age); }
        };
        obj.regular(); // 42 (this refers to obj)
        obj.arrow();   // undefined (this refers to the outer scope, not obj)
  ```
  - Arrow functions do not have their own `this` binding; they inherit it from their surrounding (lexical) context.

  **Example 6: this in Constructor Functions / Classes**
    
  ```javascript
    function Person(name) {
      this.name = name;
    }
    
    const p1 = new Person('Sudheer');
    console.log(p1.name); // Sudheer
  ```
   - When used with new, this refers to the newly created object.

453. ### What are the uses of closures?
     Closures are a powerful feature in programming languages like JavaScript. They allow functions to retain access to variables from their containing (enclosing) scope even after the outer function has finished executing. This means that a function defined within another function can access variables from the outer function, even if the outer function has already returned.
     Here are some common use cases of closures:

- Data Privacy: Closures can be used to create private variables and methods. By defining variables within a function's scope and returning inner functions that have access to those variables, you can create a form of encapsulation, limiting access to certain data or functionality.

- Function Factories: Closures are often used to create functions with pre-set parameters. This is useful when you need to create multiple functions with similar behavior but different configurations.

- Callback Functions: Closures are frequently used in asynchronous programming, such as handling event listeners or AJAX requests. The inner function captures variables from the outer scope and can access them when the callback is invoked.

- Memoization: Closures can be used for memoization, a technique to optimize performance by caching the results of expensive function calls. The inner function can remember the results of previous calls and return the cached result if the same input is provided again.

- iterators and Generators: Closures can be used to create iterators and generators, which are essential for working with collections of data in modern JavaScript.

454. ### What are the phases of execution context?
     The execution context in JavaScript is a data structure that stores the information necessary for executing a piece of code. It includes the code itself, the values of the variables used in the code, and the scope chain. The scope chain is a list of objects that are used to resolve variable names.

The execution context has two phases:

- Creation phase: In this phase, the JavaScript engine creates the execution context and sets up the script's environment. This includes creating the variable object and the scope chain.
- Execution phase: In this phase, the JavaScript engine executes the code in the execution context. This includes evaluating expressions, assigning values to variables, and calling functions.

The execution context is created when a function is called. The function's code is then executed in the execution context. When the function returns, the execution context is destroyed.

455. ### What are the possible reasons for memory leaks?

     Memory leaks can lead to poor performance, slow loading times and even crashes in web applications. Some of the common causes of memory leaks are listed below,

     1. The execessive usage of global variables or omitting the `var` keyword in local scope.
     2. Forgetting to clear the timers set up by `setTimeout` or `setInterval`.
     3. Closures retain references to variables from their parent scope, which leads to variables might not garbage collected even they are no longer used.

456. ### What are the optimization techniques of V8 engine?

     V8 engine uses the below optimization techniques.

     1. **Inline expansion:** It is a compiler optimization by replacing the function calls with the corresponding function blocks.
     2. **Copy elision:** This is a compiler optimization method to prevent expensive extra objects from being duplicated or copied.
     3. **Inline caching:** It is a runtime optimization technique where it caches the execution of older tasks those can be lookup while executing the same task in the future.

457. ### What are the examples of built-in higher order functions?

     There are several built-in higher order functions exists on arrays, strings, DOM and promise methods in javascript. These higher order functions provides significant level of abstraction. The list of functions on these categories are listed below,

     1. **arrays:** map, filter, reduce, sort, forEach, some etc.
     2. **DOM**: The DOM method `element.addEventListener(type, handler)` also accepts the function handler as a second argument.
     3. **Strings:** replace() method.

458. ### What are the benefits higher order functions?
     The main benefits of higher order functions are:
     1. Abstraction
     2. Reusability
     3. Immutability
     4. Modularity

459. ### How do you create polyfills for map, filter and reduce methods?

The polyfills for array methods such as map, filter and reduce methods can be created using array prototype.

1.  **map:**

    The built-in `Array.map` method syntax will be helpful to write polyfill. The map method takes the callback function as an argument and that callback function can have below three arguments passed into it.

    i. Current value
    ii. Index of current value(optional)
    iii. array(optional)

    The syntax would like below,

    ```js
    let newArray = arr.map(callback(currentValue[, index, arr) {
       // return new array after executing the code
    })
    ```

    Let's build our map polyfill based on the above syntax,

    ```js
    Array.prototype.myMap = function (cb) {
      let newArr = [];
      for (let i = 0; i < this.length; i++) {
        newArr.push(cb(this[i], i, this));
      }
      return newArr;
    };

    const nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    const multiplyByTwo = nums.myMap((x) => x * 2);
    console.log(multiplyByTwo); // [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
    ```

    In the above code, custom method name 'myMap' has been used to avoid conflicts with built-in method.

2.  **filter:**
    Similar to map method, `Array.filter` method takes callback function as an argument and the callback function can have three agurguments passed into it.

        i. Current value
        ii. Index of current value(optional)
        iii. array(optional)

    The syntax looks like below,

    ```js
    let newArray = arr.filter(callback(currentValue[, index, arr) {
      // return new array whose elements satisfy the callback conditions
    })
    ```

    Let's build our filter polyfill based on the above syntax,

    ```js
    Array.prototype.myFilter = function (cb) {
      let newArr = [];
      for (let i = 0; i < this.length; i++) {
        if (cb(this[i], i, this)) {
          newArr.push(this[i]);
        }
      }
      return newArr;
    };

    const nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];
    const evenNums = nums.myFilter((x) => x % 2);
    console.log(evenNums); // [2, 4, 6]
    ```

3.  **reduce:**

          The built-in `Array.reduce` method syntax will be helpful to write our own polyfill. The reduce method takes the callback function as first argument and the initial value as second argument.

          The callback function can have four arguments passed into it.
          i. Accumulator
          ii. Current value
          iii. Index of current value(optional)
          iv. array(optional)

        The syntax would like below,

        ```js
        arr.reduce(callback((acc, curr, i, arr) => {}), initValue);
        ```
        Let's build our reduce polyfill based on the above syntax,

        ```js
        Array.prototype.myReduce = function(cb, initialValue) {
            let accumulator = initialValue;
            for(let i=0; i< this.length; i++) {
                accumulator = accumulator ? cb(accumulator, this[i], i, this) : this[i];
            }
            return accumulator;
        }
          const nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];
          const sum = nums.myReduce((acc, curr, i, arr) => {
            return acc += curr
          }, 0);
          console.log(sum); // 21
        ```

460. ### What is the difference between map and forEach functions?

    Both map and forEach functions are used to iterate over an arrays but there are some differences in their functionality.

    1. **Returning values:** The `map` method returns a new array with transformed elements whereas `forEach` method returns `undefined` eventhough both of them are doing the same job.

    ```javascript
      const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
      arr.map(x => x * x); // [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
      arr.forEach(x => x * x); //

      The `forEach()` method in JavaScript always returns undefined. This is because forEach() is used to iterate over arrays and perform side effects on each element, rather than returning a `new array or transforming the original array`
    ```

    2. **Chaining methods:** The `map` method is chainable. i.e, It can be attached with `reduce`, `filter`, `sort` and other methods as well. Whereas `forEach` cannot be attached with any other methods because it returns `undefined` value.

    ```javascript
    const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    arr.map((x) => x * x).reduce((total, cur) => total + cur); // 55
    arr.forEach((x) => x * x).reduce((total, cur) => total + cur); //Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefine(reading 'reduce')
    ```

    3. **Mutation:** The `map` method doesn't mutate the original array by returning new array. Whereas `forEach` method also doesn't mutate the original array but it's callback is allowed to mutate the original array.

    **Note:** Both these methods existed since ES5 onwards.

461. ### Give an example of statements affected by automatic semicolon insertion?

     The javascript parser will automatically add a semicolon while parsing the source code. For example, the below common statements affected by Automatic Semicolon Insertion(ASI).

     1. An empty statement
     2. var statement
     3. An expression statement
     4. do-while statement
     5. continue statement
     6. break statement
     7. return statement
     8. throw statement

462. ### What are the event phases of a browser?

     There are 3 phases in the lifecycle of an event propagation in JavaScript,

     1. **Capturing phase:** This phase goes down gradually from the top of the DOM tree to the target element when a nested element clicked. Before the click event reaching the final destination element, the click event of each parent's element must be triggered.

     2. **Target phase:** This is the phase where the event originally occurred reached the target element .

     3. **Bubbling phase:** This is reverse of the capturing phase. In this pase, the event bubbles up from the target element through it's parent element, an ancestor and goes all the way to the global window object.

     The pictorial representation of these 3 event phases in DOM looks like below,

     Proxies are not used in regular day to day JavaScript work but they enabled many exciting programming patterns. Some of the real world use cases are listed below,

     1. Vue3 used proxy concept to implement reactive state
     2. SolidJS implemented reactive stores
     3. Immerjs built upon proxy to track updates to immutable updates
     4. ZenStack improved Prisma ORM for access control layer

464. ### What are hidden classes?

     Since JavaScript is a dynamic programming language, you can add or remove properties and methods from objects on the fly at runtime. This nature of JavaScript increases the dynamic dictionary lookups(because objects implemented as HashTables in memory) for retrieving a property on an object.

     Let's consider the following example to see how the additional properties `age` and `gender` added at runtime.

     ```javascript
     function Person(name) {
       this.name = name;
     }

     var person1 = new Person("John");
     var person2 = new Person("Randy");

     person1.age = 40;
     person1.gender = "Male";

     person2.gender = "Female";
     person2.age = 50;
     ```

     As a result, this behavior leads to lower JavaScript performance compared to the contiguous buffer method used in non-dynamic languages. The V8 engine provided a solution named **hidden classes** to optimize the access time when retrieving a property on an object. This optimization is achieved by sharing hidden classes among objects created in a similar fashion. These hidden classes are attached to each and every object to track its shape.

     When V8 engine sees the constructor function(e.g, Person) is declared, it creates a hidden class (let's say Class01) without any offsets. Once the first property assignment statement (`this.name = name`) is executed, V8 engine will create a new hidden class (let's say Class02), inheriting all properties from the previous hidden class (Class01), and assign the property to offset 0. This process enables compiler to skip dictionary lookup when you try to retrieve the same property(i.e, name). Instead, V8 will directly point to Class02. The same procedure happens when you add new properties to the object.

     For example, adding `age` and `gender` properties to `Person` constructor leads to transition of hidden classes(Class02 -> Class03 -> Class04). If you create a second object(Person2) based on the same Person object, both Class01 and Class02 hidden classes are going to be shared. However, the hidden classes Class03 and Class04 cannot be shared because second object has been modified with a different order of properties assignment.

     Since both the objects(person1 and person2) do not share the hidden classes, now V8 engine cannot use **Inline Caching** technique for the faster access of properties.

465. ### What is inline caching?

Inline caching is an optimization technique based on the observation that repeated calls to same function tends to occur on same type of objects. The V8 compiler stores a cache of the type of objects that were passed as a parameter in recent method calls. Upon next time when same function is called, compiler can directly search for the type in cache.

Let's consider an example where the compiler stores the shape type in cache for repeated calls in the loop.

```js
let shape = { width: 30, height: 20 }; // Compiler store the type in cache as { width: <int>, height: <int>} after repeated calls

function area(obj) {
  //Calculate area
}
for (let i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
  area(shape);
}
```

After few successful calls of the same area method to its same hidden class, V8 engine omits the hidden class lookup and simply adds the offset of the property to the object pointer itself. As a result, it increases the execution speed.

There are mainly 3 types of inline caching possible:

1. Monomorphic: This is a optimized caching technique in which there can be always same type of objects passed.
2. Polymorphic: This ia slightly optimized caching technique in which limited number of different types of objects can be passed.
3. Megamorphic: It is an unoptimized caching in which any number of different objects can be passed.

466. ### What are the different ways to execute external scripts?

     There are three different ways to execute external scripts,

     1. async: The script is downloaded in parallel to parsing the page, and executed as soon as it is available even before parsing completes. The parsing of the page is going to be interuppted once the script is downloaded completely and then the script is executed. Thereafter, the parsing of the remaining page will continue.

        The syntax for async usage is as shown below,

        ```html
        <script src="demo.js" async></script>
        ```

     2. defer: The script is downloaded in parallel to parsing the page, and executed after the page has finished parsing.

        The syntax for defer usage is as shown below,

        ```html
        <script src="demo.js" defer></script>
        ```

     3. Neither async or defer: The script is downloaded and executed immediately by blocking parsing of the page until the script execution is completed.

     **Note:** You should only use either async or defer attribute if the `src` attribute is present.

467. ### What is Lexical Scope?

     Lexical scope is the ability for a function scope to access variables from the parent scope.

     ```js
     <script>
             function x(){
               var a=10;
               function y(){
                   console.log(a); // will print a , because of lexical scope, it will first look 'a' in
               //its local memory space and then in its parent functions memory space
               }
               y();
           }
           x();
     </script>
     ```

468. ### How to detect system dark mode in javascript?

     The combination of `Window.matchMedia()` utility method along with media query is used to check if the user has selected a dark color scheme in their operating system settings or not. The CSS media query `prefers-color-scheme` needs to be passed to identify system color theme.

     The following javascript code describes the usage,

     ```javascript
     const hasDarkColorScheme = () =>
       window.matchMedia &&
       window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches;
     ```

     You can also watch changes to system color scheme using `addEventListener`,

     ```javascript
     window
       .matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)")
       .addEventListener("change", (event) => {
         const theme = event.matches ? "dark" : "light";
       });
     ```

     **Note:** The matchMedia method returns **MediaQueryList** object stores information from a media query.

469. ### What is the purpose of requestAnimationFrame method?
     The requestAnimationFrame() method in JavaScript is used to schedule a function to be called before the next repaint of the browser window, allowing you to create smooth, efficient animations. It's primarily used for animations and visual updates, making it an essential tool for improving performance when you're animating elements on the web.

```javascript
const element = document.getElementById("myElement");
function animate() {
  let currentPosition = parseInt(window.getComputedStyle(element).left, 10);

  // Move the element 2px per frame
  currentPosition += 2;
  element.style.left = currentPosition + "px";
  // If the element hasn't moved off-screen, request the next frame
  if (currentPosition < window.innerWidth) {
    requestAnimationFrame(animate);
  }
}
// Start the animation
requestAnimationFrame(animate);
```

470. ### What is the difference between substring and substr methods?

     Both `substring` and `substr` are used to extract parts of a string, but there are subtle differences between the substring() and substr() methods in terms of **syntax** and **behavior**.

     1. `substring(start, end)`
         - **Parameters:**
             - `start`: The index to start extracting (inclusive).
             - `end`: The index to stop extracting (exclusive).
         - **Behavior:**
             - If `start > end`, it **swaps the arguments**.
             - Negative values are treated as `0`.

         ```javascript
          let str = "Hello World";
          console.log(str.substring(0, 5));   // "Hello"
          console.log(str.substring(5, 0));   // "Hello" (swapped)
          console.log(str.substring(-3, 4));  // "Hell" (negative = 0)
         ```
     2. `substr(start, length)` _(Deprecated)_

         - **Parameters:**
           - `start`: The index to start extracting.
           - `length`: The number of characters to extract.
         - **Behavior:**
           - If `start` is negative, it counts from the **end** of the string.
           - If `length` is omitted, it extracts to the end of the string.

         ```javascript
         let str = "Hello World"; console.log(str.substr(0, 5)); // "Hello" 
         console.log(str.substr(-5, 3)); // "Wor" (starts from 'W')`
         ```
         **Note:** substr() is considered a legacy feature in ECMAScript, so it is best to avoid using it if possible.

471. ### How to find the number of parameters expected by a function?
     The function's object has a **length** property which tells you how many formal parameters expected by a function. This is a static value defined by the function, not the number of arguments the function is called with(**arguments.length**). The basic usage of length propery is,

```javascript
function multiply(x, y) {
  return x * y;
}

function sum(a, b, c) {
  return a + b + c;
}

console.log(multiply.length); //2
console.log(sum.length); //3
```

But there are few important rules which needs to be noted while using length property.

1. **Default values:** Only the parameters which exists before a default value are considered.
   ```javascript
   function sum(a, b = 2, c = 3) {
     return a + b + c;
   }
   console.log(sum.length); // 1
   ```
2. **Rest params:** The rest parameters are excluded with in length property.
   ```javascript
   function sum(a, b, ...moreArgs) {
     let total = a + b;
     for (const arg of moreArgs) {
       total += arg;
     }
     return total;
   }
   console.log(sum.length); // 2
   ```
3. **Destructuring patterns:** Each destructuring pattern counted as a single parameter.

   ```javascript
   function func([a, b], { x, y }) {
     console.log(a + b, x, y);
   }

   console.log(func.length); // 2
   ```

**Note:** The Function constructor is itself a function object and it has a length property of 1.

472. ### What is globalThis, and what is the importance of it?

     Nowadays JavaScript language is used in a wide variety of environments and each environment has its own object model. Due to this fact, there are different ways(syntax) to access the global object.

     1. In web browser, the global object is accessible via `window`, `self`, or `frames`.
     2. In Node environment, you have to use `global`.
     3. In Web workers, the global object is available through `self`.

The `globalThis` property provides a standard way of accessing the global object without writing various code snippet to support multiple environments. For example, the global object retuned from multiple environments as shown below,

```javascript
//1. browser environment
console.log(globalThis); // => Window {...}

//2. node.js environment
console.log(globalThis); // => Object [global] {...}

//3. web worker environment
console.log(globalThis); // => DedicatedWorkerGlobalScope {...}
```

473. ### What are the array mutation methods?
     JavaScript array methods can be categorized into two groups:
1. Mutating methods: These are the methods that directly modify the original array.
1. Non-mutating methods: These methods return a new array without altering the original one.

There are 9 methods in total that mutate the arrays,

1.  **push:** Adds one or more elements to the end of the array and returns the new length.
2.  **pop:** Removes the last element from the array and returns that element.
3.  **unshift:** Adds one or more elements to the beginning of the array and returns the new length..
4.  **shift:** Removes the first element from the array and returns that element.
5.  **splice:** Adds or removes elements from the array at a specific index position.
6.  **sort:** Sorts the elements of the array in-place based on a given sorting criteria.
7.  **reverse:** Reverses the order of elements in the given array.
8.  **fill:** Fills all elements of the array with a specific value.
9.  **copyWithIn:** Copies a sequence of elements within the array to a specified target index in the same array.

474. ### What is module scope in JavaScript?
     Module scope is a feature introduced with ES6 (ES2015) modules that creates a scope specific to a module file, isolating variables and functions declared within it from the global scope and other modules. Variables and functions declared in a module are private by default and can only be accessed by other modules if they are explicitly exported.

Key characteristics of module scope:

1.  Variables declared in a module are scoped to that module only.
2.  Each module has its own top-level scope
3.  Variables and functions need to be explicitly exported to be used in other modules
4.  The global scope cannot access module variables unless they are explicitly exported and imported
5.  Modules are always executed in strict mode

```javascript
// moduleA.js

// This variable is PRIVATE to moduleA. It's like a tool inside a closed box.
const privateVariable = "I am private";

// This variable is PUBLIC because it's exported. Others can use it when they import moduleA.
export const publicVariable = "I am public";

// PUBLIC function because it's exported. But it can still access privateVariable inside moduleA.
export function publicFunction() {
  console.log(privateVariable); // ✅ This works because we're inside the same module.
  return "Hello from publicFunction!";
}

// moduleB.js

// Importing PUBLIC items from moduleA.
import { publicVariable, publicFunction } from "./moduleA.js";

console.log(publicVariable); // ✅ "I am public" - Works because it's exported.
console.log(publicFunction()); // ✅ "Hello from publicFunction!" - Works as well.

// ❌ This will cause an ERROR because privateVariable was NOT exported from moduleA.
// console.log(privateVariable);   // ❌ ReferenceError: privateVariable is not defined
```

Common use cases and benefits:

- Encapsulation of module-specific code
- Prevention of global scope pollution
- Better code organization and maintenance
- Explicit dependency management
- Protection of private implementation details

475. ### What are shadowing and illegal shadowing?
     
     Both **shadowing** and **illegal shadowing** refer to how variable names can "hide" or override others within nested scopes.

     **Shadowing** occurs when a variable declared within a certain scope (like a function or block) has the same name as a variable declared in an outer scope. The inner variable shadows the outer one — meaning, the inner variable takes precedence in its own scope.

     Let's take an example where the inner `a` inside `func()` shadows the outer variable `a`.

      ```javascript
      let a = 10;

      function func() {
        let a = 20; // Shadows the outer 'a'
        console.log(a); // 20
      }

      func();
      console.log(a); // 10
      ```

     **Illegal shadowing** in JavaScript refers to a syntax error that happens when you try to declare a block-scoped variable (`let` or `const`) with the same name as a variable declared using `var` in the same or an overlapping scope. 

     For example, if you declare both block-scoped variable and function scoped variable using the same name inside a function causes an illegal shadowing.

      ```javascript
      function test() {
        var a = 10;
        let a = 20; // SyntaxError: Identifier 'a' has already been declared
      }
      ```
    
      As an another example, if you declare a variable with `let` or `const` in an outer scope, and then try to redeclare it with `var` inside a nested block, JavaScript throws an error — even though `var` is supposed to be function-scoped. Since the var appears in a block, it ends up trying to overwrite the `let` in the outer scope, which causes a conflict.

      ```javascript
      let a = 10;
      {
        var a = 20; // SyntaxError: Identifier 'a' has already been declared
        console.log(a);
      }
      ```

476. ### Why is it important to remove event listeners after use?
     
  In JavaScript, you need to be mindful of removing event listeners to avoid memory leaks — especially in long-lived apps like single-page applications (SPAs) or when working with frameworks/libraries. Eventhough JavaScript has automatic garbage collection, memory leaks can still happen if:

  1. A DOM element is removed, but a listener still references it.
  2. A callback (event listener) holds a reference to a large object or closure that can't be cleaned up.
  3. Global objects like window, document etc retain listeners indefinitely unless manually removed.

  So if you add any event listeners to DOM element, it is a good practice to remove it after its usage as shown below,

  ```javascript
     const button = document.getElementById("btn");

      function handleClick() {
        console.log("Clicked!");
      }

      button.addEventListener("click", handleClick);

      // Always remove when done
      button.removeEventListener("click", handleClick);
  ```

477. ### What is structuredClone and how is it used for deep copying objects?

      In JavaScript, `structuredClone()` is a built-in method used to create a **deep copy** of a value. It safely clones nested objects, arrays, Maps, Sets, Dates, TypedArrays, and even circular references — without sharing references to the original value. This prevents accidental mutations and makes it useful for state management and data processing.

       For example, the below snippet demonstrates deep cloning of a nested object,

        ```javascript
           const originalObject = {
             name: "Deep Copy Test",
             nested: {
            value: 10,
            list: [1, 2, 3]
  },
};

    const deepCopy = structuredClone(originalObject);

    // Modify cloned value
    deepCopy.nested.value = 99;
    deepCopy.nested.list.push(4);
    console.log(originalObject.nested.value); // 10
    console.log(deepCopy.nested.value);       // 99
    console.log(originalObject.nested.list);  // [1, 2, 3]
    console.log(deepCopy.nested.list);        // [1, 2, 3, 4]

478. ### What is the difference between const and Object.freeze

     The main difference is that `const` applies to **variables** (bindings), while `Object.freeze()` applies to **values** (objects).

     1. **`const`**: Prevents the reassignment of a variable identifier. It ensures that the variable name always points to the same memory reference. However, if the variable holds an object or array, the *contents* of that object can still be modified.
     2. **`Object.freeze()`**: Prevents the modification of an object's properties. It makes the object immutable (you cannot add, remove, or change properties), but it does not affect the variable assignment itself (unless the variable is also declared with `const`).

     **Example:**

     ```javascript
       // Case 1: Using const (Reassignment prevented, Mutation allowed)
       const person = { name: "John" };
       person.name = "Doe"; // ✅ Allowed: The object is mutable
       console.log(person.name); // "Doe"

       // person = { name: "Jane" }; // ❌ Error: Assignment to constant variable

       // Case 2: Using Object.freeze (Reassignment allowed, Mutation prevented)
       let profile = { name: "John" };
       Object.freeze(profile);

       profile.name = "Doe"; // ❌ Ignored (or throws TypeError in strict mode)
       console.log(profile.name); // "John"

       profile = { name: "Jane" }; // ✅ Allowed: 'profile' is declared with 'let'
       console.log(profile.name); // "Jane"

console.log(car);

function Vehicle(model, color, year, country) {
  this.model = model;
  this.color = color;
  this.year = year;
  this.country = country;
}
```

- 2: ReferenceError: X is not defined
- 3: 1, undefined and number
- 4: 1, number and number

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

##### Answer: 3

Of course the return value of `foo()` is 1 due to the increment operator. But the statement `let x = y = 0` declares a local variable x. Whereas y declared as a global variable accidentally. This statement is equivalent to,

```javascript
let x;
window.y = 0;
x = window.y;
```

Since the block scoped variable x is undefined outside of the function, the type will be undefined too. Whereas the global variable `y` is available outside the function, the value is 0 and type is number.

##### Answer: 4

The statements order is based on the event loop mechanism. The order of statements follows the below order,

1. At first, the main function is pushed to the stack.
2. Then the browser pushes the first statement of the main function( i.e, A's console.log) to the stack, executing and popping out immediately.
3. But `setTimeout` statement moved to Browser API to apply the delay for callback.
4. In the meantime, C's console.log added to stack, executed and popped out.
5. The callback of `setTimeout` moved from Browser API to message queue.
6. The `main` function popped out from stack because there are no statements to execute
7. The callback moved from message queue to the stack since the stack is empty.
8. The `console.log` for B is added to the stack and display on the console.

```

- 1: false
- 2: true

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

##### Answer: 1

This is due to the float point math problem. Since the floating point numbers are encoded in binary format, the addition operations on them lead to rounding errors. Hence, the comparison of floating points doesn't give expected results.

#### 5. What is the output of below code

```javascript
var y = 1;
if (function f() {}) {
  y += typeof f;
}
console.log(y);
```

- 1: 1function
- 2: 1object
- 3: ReferenceError
- 4: 1undefined

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

##### Answer: 4

The main points in the above code snippets are,

1. You can see function expression instead function declaration inside if statement. So it always returns true.
2. Since it is not declared(or assigned) anywhere, f is undefined and typeof f is undefined too.

In other words, it is same as

```javascript
var y = 1;
if ("foo") {
  y += typeof f;
}
console.log(y);
```

**Note:** It returns 1object for MS Edge browser

- 1: Hello World
- 2: Object {message: "Hello World"}
- 3: Undefined
- 4: SyntaxError

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

##### Answer: 3

This is a semicolon issue. Normally semicolons are optional in JavaScript. So if there are any statements(in this case, return) missing semicolon, it is automatically inserted immediately. Hence, the function returned as undefined.

Whereas if the opening curly brace is along with the return keyword then the function is going to be returned as expected.

```javascript
function foo() {
  return {
    message: "Hello World",
  };
}
console.log(foo()); // {message: "Hello World"}
```

- 3: [empty, 'b', 'c', 'd'], undefined, 4
- 4: [null, 'b', 'c', 'd'], undefined, 4

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

##### Answer: 3

The `delete` operator will delete the object property but it will not reindex the array or change its length. So the number or elements or length of the array won't be changed.
If you try to print myChars then you can observe that it doesn't set an undefined value, rather the property is removed from the array. The newer versions of Chrome use `empty` instead of `undefined` to make the difference a bit clearer.

The important point is that if the statement contains the same operators(e.g, < or >) then it can be evaluated from left to right.
The first statement follows the below order,

1. console.log(1 < 2 < 3);
2. console.log(true < 3);
3. console.log(1 < 3); // True converted as `1` during comparison
4. True

Whereas the second statement follows the below order,

1. console.log(3 > 2 > 1);
2. console.log(true > 1);
3. console.log(1 > 1); // False converted as `0` during comparison

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

##### Answer: 2

In non-strict mode, the regular JavaScript functions allow duplicate named parameters. The above code snippet has duplicate parameters on 1st and 3rd parameters.
The value of the first parameter is mapped to the third argument which is passed to the function. Hence, the 3rd argument overrides the first parameter.

**Note:** In strict mode, duplicate parameters will throw a Syntax Error.

```

- 1: ReferenceError: arguments is not defined
- 2: 3
- 3: undefined
- 4: null

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

##### Answer: 1

Arrow functions do not have an `arguments, super, this, or new.target` bindings. So any reference to `arguments` variable tries to resolve to a binding in a lexically enclosing environment. In this case, the arguments variable is not defined outside of the arrow function. Hence, you will receive a reference error.

Where as the normal function provides the number of arguments passed to the function

```javascript
const func = function () {
  return arguments.length;
};
console.log(func(1, 2, 3));
```

But If you still want to use an arrow function then rest operator on arguments provides the expected arguments

```javascript
const arrowFunc = (...args) => args.length;
console.log(arrowFunc(1, 2, 3));
```

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

##### Answer: 2

In order to be consistent with functions like `String.prototype.padStart`, the standard method name for trimming the whitespaces is considered as `trimStart`. Due to web web compatibility reasons, the old method name 'trimLeft' still acts as an alias for 'trimStart'. Hence, the prototype for 'trimLeft' is always 'trimStart'

##### Answer: 4

The `indexOf` uses strict equality operator(===) internally and `NaN === NaN` evaluates to false. Since indexOf won't be able to find NaN inside an array, it returns -1 always.
But you can use `Array.prototype.findIndex` method to find out the index of NaN in an array or You can use `Array.prototype.includes` to check if NaN is present in an array or not.

```javascript
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, NaN];
console.log(numbers.findIndex(Number.isNaN)); // 4

console.log(numbers.includes(NaN)); // true
```

Async functions always return a promise. But even if the return value of an async function is not explicitly a promise, it will be implicitly wrapped in a promise. The above async function is equivalent to below expression,

##### Answer: 4

The await expression returns value 10 with promise resolution and the code after each await expression can be treated as existing in a `.then` callback. In this case, there is no return expression at the end of the function. Hence, the default return value of `undefined` is returned as the resolution of the promise. The above async function is equivalent to below expression,

```javascript
function func() {
  return Promise.resolve(10).then(() => undefined);
}

The forEach method will not wait until all items are finished but it just runs the tasks and goes next. Hence, the last statement is displayed first followed by a sequence of promise resolutions.

Symbol follows below conventions,

2. `Symbol.for()` function creates a symbol in a global symbol registry list. But it doesn't necessarily create a new symbol on every call, it checks first if a symbol with the given key is already present in the registry and returns the symbol if it is found. Otherwise a new symbol created in the registry.

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

##### Answer: 4

The return value of `typeof myNumber` or `typeof myString` is always a truthy value (either "number" or "string"). The ! operator operates on either `typeof myNumber` or `typeof myString`, converting them to boolean values. Since the value of both `!typeof myNumber` and `!typeof myString` is false, the if condition fails, and control goes to else block.

To make the ! operator operate on the equality expression, one needs to add parentheses:

```
if (!(typeof myNumber === "string"))
```

Or simply use the inequality operator:

```
if (typeof myNumber !== "string")
```

##### Answer: 2

The symbols has below constraints,

1. The undefined, Functions, and Symbols are not valid JSON values. So those values are either omitted (in an object) or changed to null (in an array). Hence, it returns null values for the value array.
2. All Symbol-keyed properties will be completely ignored. Hence it returns an empty object({}).

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

##### Answer: 2

If you leave out the right-hand side assignment for the destructuring object, the function will look for at least one argument to be supplied when invoked. Otherwise you will receive an error `Error: Cannot read property 'length' of undefined` as mentioned above.

You can avoid the error with either of the below changes,

1. **Pass at least an empty object:**

```javascript
function area({ length = 10, width = 20 }) {
  console.log(length * width);
}

area({});
```

2. **Assign default empty object:**

```javascript
function area({ length = 10, width = 20 } = {}) {
  console.log(length * width);
}

area();
```

If the function argument is set implicitly(not passing argument) or explicitly to undefined, the value of the argument is the default parameter. Whereas for other falsy values('' or null), the value of the argument is passed as a parameter.

Hence, the result of function calls categorized as below,

1. The first two function calls logs number type since the type of default value is number
2. The type of '' and null values are string and object type respectively.

The generator should not be re-used once the iterator is closed. i.e, Upon exiting a loop(on completion or using break & return), the generator is closed and trying to iterate over it again does not yield any more results. Hence, the second loop doesn't print any value.

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

##### Answer: 1

11 and 10 is logged to the console.

The innerFunc is a closure which captures the count variable from the outerscope. i.e, 10. But the conditional has another local variable `count` which overwrites the ourter `count` variable. So the first console.log displays value 11.
Whereas the second console.log logs 10 by capturing the count variable from outerscope.

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

##### Answer: 3

Even though a promise is resolved immediately, it won't be executed immediately because its **.then/catch/finally** handlers or callbacks(aka task) are pushed into the queue. Whenever the JavaScript engine becomes free from the current program, it pulls a task from the queue and executes it. This is the reason why last statement is printed first before the log of promise handler.

- 2: `First line`, then print `a, b, c` in a first line, and print `Third line` as next line
- 3: Missing semi-colon error
- 4: Cannot read properties of undefined

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

##### Answer: 4

When JavaScript encounters a line break without a semicolon, the JavaScript parser will automatically add a semicolon based on a set of rules called `Automatic Semicolon Insertion` which determines whether line break as end of statement or not to insert semicolon. But it does not assume a semicolon before square brackets [...]. So the first two lines considered as a single statement as below.

```javascript
console
  .log("First line")
  [("a", "b", "c")].forEach((element) => console.log(element));
```

Hence, there will be **cannot read properties of undefined** error while applying the array square bracket on log function.

By default, the sort method sorts elements alphabetically. This is because elemented converted to strings and strings compared in UTF-16 code units order. Hence, you will see the above numbers not sorted as expected. In order to sort numerically just supply a comparator function which handles numeric sorts.

```javascript
const numbers = [11, 25, 31, 23, 33, 18, 200];
numbers.sort((a, b) => a - b);

##### Answer: 4

When the JavaScript engine parses the above code, the first two statements are asynchronous which will be executed later and third statement is synchronous statement which will be moved to callstack, executed and prints the number 3 in the console. Next, Promise is native in ES6 and it will be moved to Job queue which has high priority than callback queue in the execution order. At last, since setTimeout is part of WebAPI the callback function moved to callback queue and executed. Hence, you will see number 2 printed first followed by 1.

But after few lines of code JavaScript engine found a new function call(`changeCurrentCity()`) to update the current city with `var` re-declaration. Since each function call will create a new execution context, the same variable will have `undefined` value before the declaration and new value(`Singapore`) after the declaration. Hence, the value `undefined` print first followed by new value `Singapore` in the execution phase.

```javascript
function second() {
  var message;
  console.log(message);
}

function first() {
  var message = "first";
  second();
  console.log(message);

- 2: default, default, default
- 3: first, first, default
- 4: undefined, undefined, undefined

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

##### Answer: 1

Each context(global or functional) has it's own variable environment and the callstack of variables in a LIFO order. So you can see the message variable value from second, first functions in an order followed by global context message variable value at the end.

##### Answer: 1

The function call `functionOne` is not going to be part of scope chain and it has it's own execution context with the enclosed variable environment. i.e, It won't be accessed from global context. Hence, there will be an error while invoking the function as `functionOne is not defined`.

    var eatFruit = function () {
      console.log(this);

- 2: Window {...}, Window {...}
- 3: {name: "John", eat: f}, undefined
- 4: {name: "John", eat: f}, Window {...}

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

##### Answer: 4

`this` keyword is dynamic scoped but not lexically scoped . In other words, it doesn't matter where `this` has been written but how it has been invoked really matter. In the above code snippet, the `user` object invokes `eat` function so `this` keyword refers to `user` object but `eatFruit` has been invoked by `eat` function and `this` will have default `Window` object.

The above pit fall fixed by three ways,

1. In ES6, the arrow function will make `this` keyword as lexically scoped. Since the surrounding object of `this` object is `user` object, the `eatFruit` function will contain `user` object for `this` object.

```javascript
const user = {
  name: "John",
  eat() {
    console.log(this);
    var eatFruit = () => {
      console.log(this);
    };
    eatFruit();
  },
};
user.eat();
```

The next two solutions have been used before ES6 introduced.

2.  It is possible create a reference of `this` into a separate variable and use that new variable inplace of `this` keyword inside `eatFruit` function. This is a common practice in jQuery and AngularJS before ES6 introduced.

```javascript
const user = {
  name: "John",
  eat() {
    console.log(this);
    var self = this;
    var eatFruit = () => {
      console.log(self);
    };
    eatFruit();
  },
};
user.eat();
```

3. The `eatFruit` function can bind explicitly with `this` keyword where it refers `Window` object.

```javascript
const user = {
  name: "John",
  eat() {
    console.log(this);
    var eatFruit = function () {
      console.log(this);
    };
    return eatFruit.bind(this);
  },
};
user.eat()();
```

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

##### Answer: 3

In JavaScript, primitives are immutable i.e. there is no way to change a primitive value once it gets created. So when you try to update the string's first character, there is no change in the string value and prints the same initial value `Hello World!`. Whereas in the later example, the concatenated value is re-assigned to the same variable which will result into creation of new memory block with the reference pointing to `John Smith` value and the old memory block value(`John`) will be garbage collected.

##### Answer: 2

In JavaScript, the variables such as objects, arrays and functions comes under pass by reference. When you try to compare two objects with same content, it is going to compare memory address or reference of those variables. These variables always create separate memory blocks hence the comparison is always going to return false value.

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

##### Answer: 3

The variable `message` is still treated as closure(since it has been used in inner function) eventhough it has been declared after setTimeout function. The function with in setTimeout function will be sent to WebAPI and the variable declaration executed with in 5 seconds with the assigned value. Hence, the text declared for the variable will be displayed.

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

##### Answer: 1

Eventhough both variables `a` and `b` refer a number value, the first declaration is based on constructor function and the type of the variable is going to be `object` type. Whereas the second declaration is primitive assignment with a number and the type is `number` type. Hence, the equality operator `===` will output `false` value.

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

##### Answer: 2

Eventhough the above function returns the same result for the same arguments(input) that are passed in the function, the `console.log()` statement causes a function to have side effects because it affects the state of an external code. i.e, the `console` object's state and depends on it to perform the job. Hence, the above function considered as impure function.

##### Answer: 3

The above promises settled at the same time but one of them resolved and other one rejected. When you use `.all` method on these promises, the result will be short circuted by throwing an error due to rejection in second promise. But If you use `.allSettled` method then result of both the promises will be returned irrespective of resolved or rejected promise status without throwing any error.

```javascript
Promise.allSettled([promiseOne, promiseTwo]).then((data) => console.log(data));
```

- 2: Error: An exception is thrown
- 3: try block, Uncaught Error: Exception is thrown
- 4: Uncaught Error: Exception is thrown

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

##### Answer: 3

If you put `setTimeout` and `setInterval` methods inside the try clause and an exception is thrown, the catch clause will not catch any of them. This is because the try...catch statement works synchronously, and the function in the above code is executed asynchronously after a certain period of time. Hence, you will see runtime exception without catching the error. To resolve this issue, you have to put the try...catch block inside the function as below,

```javascript
setTimeout(() => {
  try {
    console.log("try block");
    throw new Error(`An exception is thrown`);
  } catch (err) {
    console.log("Error: ", err);
  }
}, 1000);
```

You can use `.catch()` function in promises to avoid these issues with asynchronous code.

#### 81. How do you verify two strings are anagrams or not?

An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging all the letters of a different word or phrase exactly once. For example, the anagrams of "eat" word are "tea" and "ate".

You can split each word into characters, followed by sort action and later join them back. After that you can compare those two words to verify whether those two words are anagrams or not.

```javascript
function verifyAnagrams(word1, word2) {
  return word1.split("").sort().join("") === word2.split("").sort().join("");
}
console.log(verifyAnagrams("eat", "ate"));

- 3: Reference Error: printHello is not defined, Good day
- 4: Hello, Reference Error: printMessage is not defined

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

##### Answer: 4

The function `printHello` is hoisted to the top of the global scope and prints "Hello" to the console. Even `printMessage` function is hoisted, but it is lifted to the local scope(in "printHello") it was declared in. That is the reason you will endup with reference error for second function call.

But if the second function is invoked in the first function itself, there won't be any reference error.

```javascript
printHello();

function printHello() {
  printMessage();
  console.log("Hello");

  function printMessage() {
    console.log("Good day");
  }
}
```

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

##### Answer: 1

Even though there is a timer of 5 seconds supplied to `setTimeout` callback, it won't get executed until the main thread is free and finished executing the remaining part of the code. In this example, the remaining code(while loop) takes 10seconds to finish it's execution. In the mean time, the callback will be stored in callback queue upon completion of its 5 seconds timer. After 10 seconds, the callback will be moved to callstack because the callstack is empty by poping out global execution context.

- 4: ['wäre', 'Wann', 'wöchentlich','Woche']

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

##### Answer: 3

Javascript has a native method sort that allows sorting an array of elements in-place. It will treat each element as a string and sort it alphabetically. But if you try to sort an array of strings which has non-ASCII characters, you will receive a strange result. This is because characters with an accent have higher character codes.

In this case, the sort order of an array is ['Wann', 'Woche', 'wäre', 'wöchentlich'].

If you want to sort an array of string values which has non-ASCII characters in an ascending order, there are two possible options like **localeCompare** and **Intl.Collator** provided by ECMAScript Internationalization API.

**localeCompare:**

```javascript
let arr = ["wöchentlich", "Woche", "wäre", "Wann"];
console.log(arr.sort((a, b) => a.localeCompare(b))); //['Wann', 'wäre', 'Woche', 'wöchentlich']
```

**Intl.Collator:**

```javascript
let arr = ["wöchentlich", "Woche", "wäre", "Wann"];
console.log(arr.sort(Intl.Collator().compare)); //['Wann', 'wäre', 'Woche', 'wöchentlich']
```

If a function is called with `undefined`, the `undefined` value is treated as a parameter. But if the function is not passed with any parameters, the `arguments` object doesn't include any argument eventhough the function has default function parameter. Hence, the function invocation with `undefined` has one argument and function call without any arguments has 0 arguments.

##### Answer: 3

This question is really showcasing how JavaScript mixes array reduction with low-level bitwise tricks. The code first uses .reduce() to turn the array into a single value by counting how many elements are odd, then an IIFE immediately kicks in and loops through the array again, shifting each number left by its index and XOR-ing it into the accumulator. The whole vibe is about understanding how reduction works for summarizing arrays and how bit shifting plus XOR can transform values in a way that feels mathematical rather than typical JS.
